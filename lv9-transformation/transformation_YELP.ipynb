It\\'s clean, it\\'s friendly, it\\'s well-kept. A few Thai tend be slow, this isn\\'t. The staff is friendly and efficient. And the menu has plenty of options. What stands out about this place is the spice/heat levels. Most places go to five. Spinal Tap only went to eleven. This place goes to 12, and they list out what makes the heat for every level. By the time you get to nine or so, you could put your lunch in a blender, liquify it, and use it for hot sauce on other lunches.

The pad see ew with chicken is very good; I can\\'t really say it\\'s the best, but it\\'s very good. It comes with mushrooms in addition to broccoli, carrots, cabbage, and egg, which is unique. Like a previous reviewer pointed out, a 1 will add some black pepper and a little red pepper flake to your meal. I\\'ve always wondered why, since I thought that 1 = no spice...good to know to ask for zero next time!Clean restaurant. Offer glasses near soda machine for filtered water, which I like. The service could be a little friendlier, but I understand why it\\'s not, so I roll with it and let it slide here. Other things I like are that they serve the pad see ew with a complimentary side salad w/ honey mustard dressing and white rice. Most places won\\'t mix noodles and rice, but given how spicy even a 1 can be (or rather, scalding hot, since they serve it straight from the wok), it\\'s nice to be able to cool my mouth on plain white rice or a crisp, cool salad. The prices can\\'t be beat- I\\'d say about $1-2 less than all the other \"average\" priced places.

I havent tried Thai Fusion yet because every time I go through this street, I am either going to or from someplace else. Similarly I was on the way home today and I was craving some type of snack so I decided to drop by and order a little takeout. The desserts seem overpriced but the \"entrees\" seem fairly priced. I was sad to see the old Wok place close business, and after a long vacated absence, am happy to see 1-2-3 in action, although does anyone know if they and Thai Fusion are the same owners?...speaking of, No Alcohol here, go next door if u want some.'},\n",

       "  'text': \"This is the best Thai place in the SPU area. That being said, there are only two Thai places in the area. So... The food is not bad. I have had the pad kee mao (called basil noodles? on the menu), red curry, and some stir fry chicken dish (can't remember the name). All were good. The pad kee mao was my favorite of the 3. It was well spiced and flavorful. The red curry was not bad. Rich and coconutty, but needed a little more salt and spice. A comparison of prices with these items to another Thai restaurant (in Fremont) shows that the prices are $1-2 cheaper here. However the portion sizes here are smaller (more lunch size, than dinner size). All dishes, however come with rice and a salad. Many other Thai restaurants charge for rice, so perhaps that somewhat makes up for the difference in portion size for some people. You could certainly do worse, and your options in this neighborhood are pretty limited in any case.\"},\n",

We walked in at like 9pm and waited for like 20 minutes to just be seated at the bar. The seating was strange, wrapped all around the walls and to the back, not really giving any space at all for a lobby. Look, I know its downtown on Denny, but maybe a lobby would be necessary in a city of rain and long waits to be seated??Once we were seated, I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea (which was good-not very strong though). They carded me twice. How nice of them. I also had the eggplant parmigiana. Very pleasantly surprised by the high level of happy hour food they had at Blush. Very VERY decently priced as well. The only reason I would not come back here was the wait and small seating. The eggplant was soft, delicate, and underseasoned. Maybe I am too accustomed to adding salt to my food, but I would have liked to see more fresh herbs added. Overall, decent experience, Really appreciated the high level of aesthetic for happy hour.

My friends and I were happy hour hopping and saw that this place was still serving happy hour at 7PM, so we stopped in. First off, the place was COMPLETELY empty, and it\\'s a pretty big space. That made me feel a little uncomfortable right off the bat. It was eerie. However, we learned that happy hour specials included $1.50 PBR and $4 wells, so I was willing to give it a shot. They also had tasty looking food options for $6. I ended up ordering a grayhound and my friends ordered PBR. The bartender didn\\'t know what a greyhound was. It\\'s a pretty standard drink, so I was surprised. No biggie though - we explained it to her. My drink arrived in a pint glass. I hadn\\'t ordered a double. Not only that, but it didn\\'t taste like it had any alcohol in it. The PBR came back with half foam. I asked if I could have more vodka in my drink and was informed that \"it has 1 1/2 shots, that\\'s what the book called for\". Mmmmmk. I ordered a shot of vodka to put in the greyhound, and my friend ordered one too. My other friend tried to politely explain how a greyhound should be made. The waitress actually rolled her eyes and muttered, \"I\\'m done talking to you.\" We were shocked! &#160;Insult was added to injury when the bill came. The two greyhounds we ordered were listed at $10 each, while the two additional shots were $9 each. Mind you - the happy hour menu clearly stated $4 for wells. Supposedly, the drinks were made with top shelf vodka. The manager ended up giving us a \"deal\" by only charging $5 for each drink. The food was pretty good, but the vibe and attitude of the waitress completely spoiled this place for me. On a side note, we left and went to Tini Bigs acorss the street. While there, we witnessed a couple of 18 year old girls run the curb and hit a pipe attached to Blush with their vehicle. Karma?'},\n",

Their sign used to say Blush Lounge. &#160;It\\'s now a restaurant as well so the sign had to be updated. &#160;No problem, just break out the paint and paint brush and carefully write in Resturant on the existing sign. &#160;Yeah that\\'s right Resturant, not Restaurant. &#160;How does this kind of thing happen?Next time you\\'re passing by Blush and you feel a slight twinge of curiosity by those flowing curtains that remind you of the final episode of Twin Peaks, do as Agent Cooper did and just get stabbed instead. &#160;You may have to head further downtown for that though.'},\n",

       "  'text': \"Went to Blush on Saturday to see my buddy's Chris and Johnny spin for Roy's birthday. Johnny worked his magic to get me on his extremely short guest list (3 people). When I got to the door, the door lady told me I wasn't on the list. I showed her the text message from Johnny from 2 hours before then imforming me I was on the guest list. She wasn't having it though. The place is pretty damn small so tracking down Johnny or Roy or someone who could have straightened her out should have been a cinch, but that didn't happen. So I paid. Not a big deal, I'm happy to support the scene, but I don't normally pay to see my buddies spin, especially if I'm on the damn list. I ran into Johnny within 10 seconds of walking in and he told me the same thing happened to his wife and her guest, not on the 3 person guest list that he'd provided to them. So not a single person on his list, actually made it into the hands of the all powerful door girl. So right off the bat, bad taste in my mouth for Blush. Guest list shouldn't be that hard to handle, the DJ's and promoters give their list to the door girl, simple as that. There are plenty of clubs/bars in town that have no trouble with this week in week out, apparently Blush isn't one of them.Guest list aside, Blush used to be a diner and it still looks a bit like a diner inside. It's also small, too small in my opinion. There is no way to pack a bunch of people in there without it being too crowded. There's only one door in or out of the place so it's completely hectic anywhere near the door, and half of the place is near the door. There are 2 bars, but one of them is along a corridor connecting the main room to the other room and it was just way too crowded in there. That left the other bar which was off the other room and while it was certainly more spacious than the area for the main bar, people figured that out and it got overcrowded in that area as well. And 2 bartenders at each bar just wasn't enough, if I hadn't been sneaky and aggressive in the bar lines, I would have spent most of the night waiting to order my drinks. In the end, I wouldn't waste my time with Blush...there are SOOOOO many other clubs and bars that can handle their guest lists, handle their crowds, and handle their bar lines, no point in dealing with that kind of aggrivation when there are much better options available.\"},\n",

I ordered a second beer (a Mac &amp; Jacks) but she never ended up bringing it to me. It took a while to get our bills which she was nice enough to split up for us without us even having to ask. She did try charging me for an extra beer though and got pretty defensive when I pointed it out. The other beer she claimed I had wasn't even a Mac &amp; Jacks so she was clearly just making it up.This could be a decent place due to the delicious happy hour food but it definitely needs some work.\"},\n",

Great happy hour specials and always easy seating between 5 and 7pm. The only nuisance is that they often play really loud music, which is fine at night, but is really silly when the place is almost empty in the late afternoon. Hard to talk to your companions. I am sure it is geared at a nightclub crowd, but they could get more happy hour guests if they made the ambiance more conducive to talking. I guess it would be convenient if you needed to go out with someone really annoying to talk to. I would definitely go again for the great deals on food.'},\n",

Although not the best I've had, it wasnt too bad. &#160;You cant beat the HH prices. great deals on food.As for the decor, that part was ok. &#160;it was dark with floor to ceiling curtains everywhere. &#160;the tables were moderately confortable.Although the music was sort of acid-jazzy-ish (which i typically dont enjoy), it wasn't too bad.Our waiter. Bless his heart. &#160;He was new to the whole waitering thing. &#160;So, he was a little nervous and therefore talked really softly. &#160;it was super hard to hear him. &#160;Although he was very attentive and polite, he did ring us up incorrectly by the tune of being overcharged about 70 bucks, but made up for it by saying he was comping us drinks. However the drink comping didn't happen when he recalculated the bill, or at least it didn't look like it.Overall, the place was pretty empty so it was easy to seat our group of 10, but there wasn't much in terms of atmosphere. The food was good value for the price, and the menu had lots of option. Pack a little patience for the wait staff and double check your bill.\"},\n",

It was super obnoxious there was a group of them that just kept singing and of course all the dancing had to stop for their \"show\" then they started spraying champagne all over the crowd, which they thought was awesome, um no thank you! No one came to this club to see you nobodies try and rap and take your shirts off so you can get your five minutes of feeling like you are awesome. We didn\\'t like you guys when you had the mic now we hate you and are covered in champagne and I\\'m pretty sure the staff hates you now too since they spent the next hour trying to dry up the dance floor from the wet champagne mess. On top of that we went to cash out and they marked us down for twice as many drinks than we had, not sure if they thought we were wasted and they could get away with it but totally got ripped off! And we couldn\\'t do anything about it! Our bill should have been about $50-$60 and it was $170!!! Pretty sure two girls that don\\'t drink that much drank that much in 3 hours!!!!

To be honest... this is just a late night/classier alternative to Denny's.. But the food isn't any better than Denny's. Just a lot more expensive! I certainly wouldn't be going here at regular dining hours when I had other choices.I am not going to say I'll never return because I probably will. After being out and drinking.. it's nice to have some grub and unwind. The atmosphere feels very old fashioned.. lots of leather and dark lighting. I would recommend eating in the bar area rather than the dining room. The service tends to be better in there. Also, they have live music in the bar.\"},\n",

My husband had been wanting to go here for quite a while, ever since his brother told him about the restaurant's amazing Spaghetti Carbonara, which my husband searches for on menus around the world. 13 Coins is very randomly located off Denny Way, tucked in next to the Seattle Times building. I think my former job there is the only reason I know about it, but our friends have actually been going there for years. I think it's one of the only places left in Seattle for decent 24-hour dining. We arrived around 7:30 and were seated right away in a giant leather high-backed booth.Our server arrived right away to take our drink orders and deliver a yummy appetizer dish filled with salami and veggies, as well as a fresh bread and butter basket. I tried not to eat too much bread because I wanted to save myself for my meal... the portions I glimpsed at other tables we passed looked absolutely giant!We started with Crispy Calamari with lemon garlic aioli for $11.99. My husband of course got the Spaghettini Carbonara with Italian Cascioppo sausage, Canadian bacon, and onions in a creamy fennel sauce, with Parmesan cheese for $19.99. I ordered a 10 oz cut of slow roasted Prime Rib, served with mashed potatoesand broccoli with au jus for $29.99. Everything was amazing but I honestly didn't eat more than a quarter of my meal... it was absolutely giant and most of it is sitting in a doggie bag in the refrigerator. My husband liked his dish although it was much different than typical Spaghetti Carbonara because of the sausage. 13 Coins is a little pricey, but very delicious and the portions are huge so I think we'd definitely go back again.\"},\n",

All the seating choices are awesome, either a large, engrossing leathery booth or high-back stools at the bar. The stools are great because they wrap around you a studded-leather hotdog bun - makes me want to spin abound and look at people fiendishly while stroking a white cat. Legend has it that in the 90\\'s (and before) when journalism was a prized, and respected, commodity; the newsmen and women of Seattle would flock here at night and fill the booths with local celebrity.I always have liked the service I\\'ve received. Every once in a while you\\'ll get a very personable server, and that is always nice. The manager comes around and checks on guests from time to time which gives that sense of old timey class. As a nice surprise, a few months ago I went in with a buddy to drink scotch and have a nice conversation...when we went into the bar/lounge (\"Night Owl Lounge\" or something) there was a band set up - I guess they do that weekly (Fridays?). I\\'ve heard music there twice and both times it was really nice and laid back; a Stevie Knicks type lady (requested \"Leather and Lace\" - to which she obliged) and a Soft Hawaiian (mostly acoustic) set that did a fantastic version of \"Hotel California\".Of course the food is good, some pastas but mostely grilled food. It\\'s the sort of place that makes you want red meat and scotch (or a oaky red wine) - and just be a little gluttonous/lustful and politically incorrect. I bet this place took a big hit when Seattle banned smoking and waitresses started demandin respect in their workplace.This place is not a 5 because isn\\'t unique or even inventive - just a good fashion mainstay of yesteryear. Most of the food is good, some things just slightly better than OK, but nothing life altering. But if you want to relax and melt a bit - 13 Coins, my friend.'},\n",

       "  'text': \"At one point in life this was my favorite restaurant. The food was hot, fresh and plentiful. As the years have gone on and ownership changed this place has lost its charm and flare that made then one of the best restaurants in the US. I ordered sausage and eggs and asked my sausage be well done. The last couple times I had this, the sausage was not done. The pork was pink and chewy and probably not safe to eat. I like a little crust on my sausage and at a minimum a snap to it. For me, that solidifies its completeness. The hash browns that were once thick, golden brown, yet warn and tender at the center have been replaced by a much smaller portion, and not as well cooked. Also gone is the anti-pasta tray appetizer, with bread to keep you cool while you wait for your custom made meal. Today, my meal was undercooked again and after the initial wait for the meal, I waited for what seamed like another 10 minutes for them to completely cook the sausage, In the interim, my eggs and hash browns got cold yielding a meal not worth the time, money or effort. God bless the people of 13 Coins, I'm sure they have crunched numbers, read reports and planned out something impressive on paper, but they need to return to their roots, because this legendary 5 star establishment has been reduced to an inconsistent average overpriced eatery.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'Due to my favorite Seattle takeout place being closed for not only Thanksgiving, which is totally understandable, but also Black Friday! Disappointed and dismayed I sat in the parking lot scouring Yelp! to see what could possibly be open that would be quick and easy. That search ended some minutes later and so I took to the phone.\\'What\\'s open, that is quick &amp; easy?\\' My guy replied, \"13 Coins\" to which I asked, \\'Am I going to pay 130 coins??\\' He assured me it wouldn\\'t be too expensive so I Yelp!ed it and headed over. Initially I drove by it. It is set on the first floor of what seemed to be a luxury apartment building but eventually the blue dot on my iphone map led me to the door. My initial reaction was \\'Wow! He lied!!\\' The ambiance was set to a romantic dusk, the staff was well dressed and because it was so dark appeared to be neat, but all I could hear with every step was the ringing of a cash register. I took a seat at the counter; not to be confused with the bar. I immediately grabbed the menu and to my surprise the prices weren\\'t outrageous.A little more relaxed and content with the fact I could watch my food being made I ordered a seafood omelette. My server was pleasant and brought out a petrie dish with olives, peppers and some sort of sliced meat and bread. I scarfed down the bread and guzzled the water, played a few games of Words With Friends and before I knew it my order was up. The Seafood Omelette came with Hash-browns and Toast but they may have thought I asked to hold the flavor!? Salt, pepper, something! My server offered cracked pepper and I\\'m sure he began to cramp as he cranked, I doused the hash-browns with hot sauce and dug in. The omelette was okay, at best! Each bite delivered a different flavor. The first was salty, the second was as if my scallop was frozen, the third was a blazing hot scallop and the last bite was chock full of garlic, which had been nonexistent throughout the meal and caused me to forget it was an ingredient in the dish.I requested the bill and must admit I have become a little spoiled; there was tax added to the bill. This wasn\\'t overly alarming but I quickly began to appreciate my southern local. After my hunger subsided and thought about my meal it became clear I just had a $20 omelette that was filled with frozen scallops and canned baby shrimp. The audible I called was not Peyton-esque by any means and though 13 Coins is a 24 hour eatery I would have been better off hitting the other all night breakfast spot that overwhelms you with their portion size. Despite my review 13 Coins isn\\'t bad they just don\\'t meet the standard to which they\\'re dressed and their dress appears to be what you are paying for.'},\n",

While Seattle has a massive foodie scene, there is not much open after 11 PM for decent eats (unlike Portland which has stupendous late night eats...check out Little Bird). &#160; So, I often find myself sauntering into 13 Coins bleary eyed and wanting food. &#160; For those who know me, I become a complete zombie nay blithering idiot when my blood sugar gets too low. &#160; Something about glycogen stores and how my brain is wired. &#160; &#160;I like 13 Coins for a few reasons. &#160; &#160;Firstly, I come from the East Coast. &#160; And for those of you who have spent any time in the NY Metro area know about the reliable greek diners that are everywhere. &#160; Those diners are open 24/7, have solid, stick-to-your ribs food served by plump grannies dressed in black and white, and are a great value to night owls, travelers, and drunks (all of which I have been at some point). &#160;13 Coins is like this.... yet with an oddly old school Pacific Northwest Club Lounge flair. &#160; &#160;Super high-back booths. &#160; Crushed Velvet seating. &#160; &#160;Decent service. &#160; Giant portions. &#160;Average food, but a great selection. &#160; &#160;Avoid the fresh fish dishes...ironically (but the clams are great). &#160; &#160; They seem to like to take a beautiful slab of fresh halibut, coat it in stale egg batter and deep fry it until it can be used to split wood. &#160; &#160;Otherwise all other dishes are quite good. &#160; &#160;Try the pasta dishes, the fried chicken, and of course the super consistent egg dishes with biscuits and gravy.\"},\n",

I came here for a chill happy hour to check it out since I haven\\'t been here in years. I love elegantly designed the decor is and how the settings are so romantic and chill. My friend and I were seated in the bar area where there were nice decor and dim lights. We sat and was immediately given water to start. Their happy hour is small, but they also have late night eats too. We ordered the calamari with lemon aoili, the brie cheese with crackers and bread, the salmon sliders, and deviled eggs. The brie and bread was good, but I didn\\'t see a point of the crackers and bread since the brie was inside a bread already, with jam on top. Perhaps it\\'s my lack of experience, but I was really confused. The bread it was inside was flaky and soft like a croissant. Very tasty. The calamari wasn\\'t bad, it wasn\\'t the best. But it was delicious with the aoili. the aoili was made to perfection and definitely complimented the calamari. The calamari was a bit soft and not as crispy. The deviled eggs were okay. They tasted homemade most definitely, but it lacked salt and I thought the yolk was just okay. The salmon slider was probably the best with the delicious pesto sauce. The bread it was on was rather dry so I didn\\'t like it all that much. But the pesto paired with the pesto was perfect. It was rich and tasty!Overall, the service was fabulous and I think they have good food. Very fast and nice!'},\n",

       "  'text': 'This place, or rather its reputation, confuses the heck out of me. \"Hangover food!\" \"Great late night stop!\" One of America\\'s Top 5 late-night restaurants according to the Food Network!Those endorsements seem to describe a no-frills 24-hour diner. But this place has frills - lots of frills. It\\'s dimly lit, even on a Sunday afternoon with the windows open. Everything is dark wood, leather, and brass. Giant, semi-secluded leather booths. The seats along the bar are like leather bucket seats from an \\'85 Trans Am. Being from the Midwest, I was struck immediately by how much this restaurant seemed to be from back home than something born in Seattle. Still, the decor is nice even if it was a bit of a shock at first.The next point of confusion: the prices. 13 Coins is not cheap. (Somehow this makes the name a little ironic.) They have a few less expensive options (breakfast food mostly), but salads and sandwiches range from $12-25 (with accompanying side dishes). Again, those aren\\'t the kind of prices I expect from \"hangover food\" or a place I wanna head to for biscuits and gravy in the middle of the night.Aside from recommendations from friends, my primary reason for visiting 13 Coins was for the Monte Cristo. That sandwich is surprisingly hard to find in Seattle, especially for a city that seems pretty excited about sandwiches in general. I\\'m happy to report that the Monte Cristo at 13 Coins was reasonably priced AND delicious. They serve theirs with strawberry jam, which is fine, but I prefer mine with syrup. (Don\\'t worry, I got syrup on the side.) I also got a side of fries, which were $7 (I didnt notice the price until I had already ordered). They were HUGE and not very fry-like. They would be better labeled as \"potato logs\" or \"big potato logs\" or \"logs of potato.\" Sorry, \"log\" is the only term I think is applicable here. Maybe just \"sliced up potato that we cooked.\" A friend splurged and ordered the ribeye steak (for about $40) but was disappointed with the less-than-generous cut of meat. I didn\\'t get a report on the taste.Now that I\\'ve been to 13 Coins I know what to expect. I do think I\\'ll go back, because that Monte Cristo hit the spot. However, this place wasn\\'t the amazing greasy spoon I had expected. So everyone, please adjust your descriptions and recommendations accordingly and save unsuspecting customers like myself some confusion. Thanks!'},\n",

It frequently comes up in internet searches as one of the best 5 late night dining establishments in the country. This seems to be unique in Seattle where many things tend to close down far earlier in the evening than in cities such as NYC, LA or Chicago.The restaurant is in a good location--you can see the Space Needle from here and it is right next to the Pan Pacific Hotel making it an outstanding place to grab a bite late at night or for brunch.I sampled the smoked salmon (and also the crab) eggs Benedict which I took \"to-go\" for eating at the hotel. I was pleased with both and with the generous portion of accompanying hash browns. The real treat was dining here around 1am when seemingly nothing else in the city was open. The burger and the shrimp scampi were both very tasty.I definitely would recommened this restaurant for any late night outings.

Sorry, but it really is ridiculously high priced, for your basic, high-cholesterol, high-calorie menu. The wait is incredibly long for your entrees. Some of the wait staff (almost all male) are very kind and welcoming, some are downright rude.I hate the way I have to go ask someone to help me open the door so that I can get my elderly mother's wheelchair through the double-door entry.And I absolutely LOATHE the only wheelchair-accessible bathroom. You have to walk past the kitchen, into the bowels of the restaurant, and into a dingy, dirty little room. For shame, 13 coins!

Pat Cashman is a local celebrity that use to do this skit on Almost Live, I don't recall the entire skit I just remember he was schmarmy as all get out and his hair must have had about 3 quarts of motor oil in it. Imagine if you will Vegas being channeled through a car dealer, your kinda cool uncle and you have pat cashman and 13 coins. I love cheesecake. I ordered my cheesecake. My cheesecake had pineapples in it, with strawberries on top. All of the food is like this. EXTREME &#160;in a &#160;1950's Dean Martin over the top weird but good sorta way. Remember those crazy cookbooks your grandmother had laying around that called for pinapples in everything. Like mmm pinapple, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Maybe its just me but Iam pretty sure 13 coins is cooking from those books.13 coins is in the wrong place and the wrong time. It belongs back in the 50's, in Vegas. It would have been a place that the classy dames and dukes hung out after a long night of listening to sinatra and gambling. &#160;Maybe next time I wear a tux, get in a fist fight with a manager, stumble drunk with my singer friend and dance in the rain I will go to 13 coins to top off my night, proper.\"},\n",

I\\'m still cringing thinking about the fact that I paid $14 (without tax or tip) for a burger that should have been $10 at most. I mean it was a decent high class (not in a prostitute kind of way) burger. But $14? No way. I\\'d happily fork over $13 for the amazing burger at Quinn\\'s but I can\\'t really get behind 13 Coins\\' version especially when it comes at an even higher price. And on top of that the food took quite a while to come out. The service was friendly and prompt it just took a really, really long time to get our food. Long enough for all of us to realize we should probably be sleeping instead of eating at a restaurant at 3 am. And how can you not have pancakes and french toast on a 24 hour menu? I mean is that just too low class for them? I have a hard time eating anything other than breakfast late at night.

He apparently had grabbed my plate before the chef had put everything on it so he brought a second plate of Joes with the proper additions. But it ddn't matter much, it was bland.

       "  'text': \"13 Coins is a little slice of breakfast heaven in the city known as Seattle. &#160;When we finally recovered from our 23 hours of travel from Boston and bachelorette shenanigans, we wanted breakfast. Badly. But it was 12 PM on a Friday.... where to go? The kind concierge at our Marriott directed us to 13 Coins.And my god, THANK YOU!! &#160;It was DELICIOUS. Yes, the prices are higher than a diner. But the quality of the food (ok, well the bacon, which is a food group all on its own), was excellent, not to mention the thick cloth napkins and very private booths. In Baw-ston, this meal would have cost 3 times what it did here (~$42 for all three of us), and I felt like I was royalty! Or at least sitting in the nice steak house equivalent of a 24 hour restaurant.When I go back to Seattle (and you know I will be), I'll certainly make it a point to stop here. Maybe twice, so I can try out what looked like a delicious lunch menu. Thank you, 13 coins, for saving our hung over breakfast-craving asses.\"},\n",

I rarely do, no matter what time of day, whether it's 3:00 am or 3:00 pm. I always order the Eggs Benedict either with crab or without. They serve this nice complimentary anti pasta tray with assorted crudite' and bread and butter. It really makes my day to get this...don't ask why?? I HAVE to sit at the counter and watch the cooks in action or it's just not the same. I just love those huge high backed seats! I always feel like I am in the fanciest restaurant in the 60's.

       "  'text': 'Due to work schedules etc. I was unabe to join my family in Boston for Thanksgiving, I knew 13 Coins was a no reservation restaurant so we decided to go. The place was packed, however we only waited 10 minutes, it was great, and despite being swamped everyone was so unbelieveably pleasent. Our server was really on it too, even stoping to pour our wine when needed. I opted for the traditional turkey dinner, and my friend had a filet, both were very good. It is on the pricey side, however I understand how this might be necessary to run and staff a place that\\'s open 24-7, everyday of the year. I always check menus on-line first, if availabe, so there was no suprise. I have to say it was worth it, it was a great experience.I feel it\\'s unfair to compare 13 Coins to a \"fine dining\" restaurant, it\\'s a 24 hour restaurant, that serves a myriad of different fares anytime of day, the privacy seating is just an added bonus. The place has been there for 40 years so, approach it with a flare for nostalgia.P.S I have had lobster there at midnight and it was delightful.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'The hubby and I were feeling hungry around 11:30pm last night and did what any supposed \"in-the-know\" Seattleite would do and headed to 13 Coins. I\\'d heard good reviews so I was intrigued.13 Coins is located in a rather odd, almost industrial part of Seattle. It\\'s not the easiest place to find. The outside of the establishment looks like a late 60\\'s stuccoed office building. Not terribly appealing. The inside reminded me of the steakhouse my grandparent\\'s owned in San Diego for almost 30 years. All wood paneling and immitation leather. You\\'d expect to see Sinatra at the bar with his ubiquitous glass of scotch. With a little renovation (new veneer, leather, and flooring) it could really be a great space.One thing I really love is the booths and the setup of the tables. At least in the area I was in, all the tables are tucked off into corners so it\\'s actually quiet enough to hold a converation without having to strain to hear! Unfortuately, this is practically an anomaly in restaurants nowadays.The Menu is extensive. They have a wide selection of steaks (of course!), poultry, and seafoods as well as pasta. It took the hubby and I quite a while to take it all in! Eventually, he settled on a small mixed green salad with bleu cheese and linguine in clam sauce. I ordered the same salad and went for the large 13oz Filet Mignon because my husband wanted half! I prefer my steaks rare, but the hubby likes medium (and, apparently to ruin a fine cut of meat), so we split the difference and agreed on medium rare.The salads were average. The greens were crisp and obviously fresh, but the dressing was incredibly bland and the bleu cheese sprinkled on top was dry and flavorless and it only went downhill from there. After trimming all the gristle and a rather large vein (the thing was nearly the size of a garden hose!) &#160;from my 13oz filet, I now had an 8oz filet that I paid an extra $10.00 for. And it was also cooked medium, much to the hubby\\'s delight. My husband\\'s pasta was overcooked, the clams were like little wads of rubber, and the pepper cream sauce tasted like it came from a can. Now, I really wouldn\\'t have been that disapponted if the bill hadn\\'t come to $77.00, not including the tip!!! I\\'ve had better meals at friggin\\' Claim Jumper!After all the good reviews I was shocked at the lack of quality. As I ate, I considered that I my expectations could\\'ve been a bit high, but honestly, I can\\'t see where anyone with functioning tastebuds could call this \"good\" food. It was \"average\" at best. And that\\'s being generous.If people think this is good food, what are they eating at home for god\\'s sake???'},\n",

       "  'text': \"I came here with my parents because they remembered it being amazing back in the day, and I also have a morbid curiosity to try places that have been bashed to the limit on Yelp (*cough*JaiThai*cough*). I've been here only once for French onion soup (which had this amazing cheesy crust), and needed to expand my experimentation to judge further.What I ordered: Escargot for an appetizer. I was so pleased. I think there were about 8 or so in this little dish sitting in a hot, buttery bath. The little snails were tender and juicy, and the leftover butter sauce was great to mop up with our free bread.Then I ordered calamari steak over pasta. I got a HUGE portion of squid, tender and juicy with a light crust, over an o.k. bed of spaghetti (pasta isn't my favorite, so I'm not the best judge on it). My mum had calf's liver, which was better than even her homemade version of it. The liver was so smooth and smothered with sauteed onions, which, if I had ordered the dish, could have been a little less crunchy, but my mum loves them that way. My dad ordered veal parmesan, which was pretty good, but nothing amazing. I wish veggies came as a side with our meals. Pasta bores me and makes me feel bloated. My mum substituted her pasta for a few red potatos, but it's not the same as getting broccoli or mushrooms or whatever. Our server was attentive and not over-the-top (I feel so akward whenever a server overcompensates with friendliness) at first. Towards the end of our meal, he just kind of faded away, and I had to flag down the manager to get our check. We waited a long time for it, and my mum fell asleep next to her wine! She can't drink like she used to.The bill was HUGE, though! Almost embarrassingly so. I mean, I got lucky ordering great entrees (nobody has reviewed these yet, as far as I've seen), but if I was footing the bill, I would have expected more out of the pasta and my dad's veal. Maybe I'm just cheap. That calamari steak was the SH*T though, man!So, no horror stories here. Try the squid and snails.*joy\"},\n",

Violation #2 &#160;Open 24 hrs = Good eating only if less than 20 seats--preferably stools--and if the place has been has been there forever, or is a hot dog truck.Violation #3 Waiters and cooks can not exist in the same space.

It was nice to see how my food is cooked for once. I don't always get this experience, so I enjoyed it. The food was decently presented and I immediately dove into the plate. It's was good and I enjoyed it. I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had, but the serving was proportional and filling. The egg benedict was good as well.The waitress was nice and the entire meal was good. I noticed a few of the other customer's plates and everything looked like it would be delicious as well! 13 Coins is opened 24 hours.

I took my GF from Toronto there before catching her flight this past Sunday and to be honest, I was embarassed! We were left there for over 10 minutes before the server greeted us and she never brought over the antipasto plate. She acted like a robot with no personality. We ordered the Escargot as an appetizer and it came with 3 cups of sauteed mushrooms drenched over the top..not the classic herb-garlic butter that I remember them preparing for years. When I asked zombie-robot chick about it she said \"we have ALWAYS served it like this\" UH..no you have not!I had ordered the chicken marsala (mushrooms) NOT knowing the new preparation on the escargot and LO and BEHOLD, I was on mushroom overload by the time my dinner came. Not once did I complain as I hate to do that having been a server for 13 years. We had a different server come over at one point (who was WAY more attentive than robot-zombie chick) who cleared our plates, packed up our food and then said \"soandso will bring your check\"....10 minutes later...NO server (although we could see her walking around)...so I asked the hostess we needed our check...she rudely said \"oh, your server will bring that over\"...well DUH...the other guy said that too! Finally another 5+ minutes goes by and here comes zombie-robot chick with one check (not separated like we asked when ordering). So that took ANOTHER 5 minutes. I was pissed.

       "  'text': 'The food here is overpriced for what you get, in my opinion. &#160;The bread they started us off with was really dry, and the antipasti plate is skimpy - celery and carrot sticks, two dill pickles and a couple slices of salami. It came with our entrees so that was fine, but I wouldn\\'t pay for it on its own. &#160;The cocktails are right around $10 each, expensive for Seattle, however my ruby red cosmopolitan was very good. &#160; The sesame seared ahi appetizer was surprisingly good, with the tuna seared just right. The accompanying \"coleslaw\" however was just a mound of shredded cabbage, as far as I could tell. &#160;The pepper steak dijon was okay, cooked to medium as requested and the sauce was good but not amazing. &#160;The side of pasta was unimpressive. &#160;I had the half spaghetti/half ravioli with meatballs and a side of garlic bread. &#160;The meatballs were fantastic, moist and full of basil. The red sauce was rich and tasty too, although the ravioli were not the best I\\'ve had. &#160;The server had forgotten the garlic bread, but it worked out alright because he rushed it out, and I had hot crispy bread to sop up my sauce. &#160;The service was fine, not too slow, and no missteps except for the late arrival of the garlic bread. &#160;The bill for two with 5 cocktails came out to $170 with tip, so yikes! If I had know we would end up spending that much, I would have suggested Anthony\\'s.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'I have to point out a few things regarding some of these reviews...1) 13 Coins DID have a distinct \"sag\" in quality... as noted by The Stranger article on the wall as you walk into the entryway (between outside and inside, effectively)... and they worked daggum hard to bring things back up.2) ASK QUESTIONS. See, if you are wanting seafood, maybe a 24/7 place isn\\'t it? I can\\'t really say... I asked questions. I found out that the minestrone we shared was all made from scratch, broth never prefab there... quite important when you\\'re like me and MSG makes you utterly sick to the point of taking that booth up on its offer to let you scooch yourself down in a fetal position for 24 hours or so...The first time I went, we\\'d been to The Saint for Happy hour, to El Corazon for ... um... the Air Sex Championship... and well, everyone else hit the Hurricane. I was actually gonna go to Habesha, but they closed the kitchen early. This place saved us from the Hurricane and its crowd of drunk, smelly, loud, drunk, loud, smelly, drunk people and decidedly awful food (hey, if even the bread is nearly inedible, it\\'s not worth my dime--Subway isn\\'t that far away, after all, and their bread is edible.That first time, I was with a dear vegetarian friend of mine. I LOVE the spinach-gorgonzola ravioli. I\\'ve had it since. So have friends. All swooned. I\\'ve had the duck. Not as amazing but GOOD. I\\'ve had the gorgonzola cheesecake (bits of it): savory, too much for 1 person to eat at one time, so I see it as a great appetizer/finisher in lieu of a cheese plate. Did i mention NUMI teas? They just bring me the whole assortment and even if I use more than 1 bag, they don\\'t charge extra and bring as much H2O as I need. What else? Oh, Hmm, 6? times later, the ravioli is (price and taste matching up) the most frequent meal (loved by ALL even carnivores, BUT if the cheese on top isn\\'t fully melted, have them shove it under the heat lamp--it MUST be melted. Period.... The seafood alfredo was really well done and likewise... so rich it was easy to share. Some came home. It survived a gentle reheating, too.This is my absolute go-to spot when I\\'m near it, especially as I\\'m never sure what\\'s open. The prices are high, yep, for much of the food, but who\\'s getting crab/lobster at 3am? That\\'s more a catering thing for me anyway. In any case, hot ravioli, superbly cozy booths, sweet people (SO sweet), managers that care... I\\'m pretty sure some of the 1 star reviews are--even if recent--not reflective. I\\'ve been so many times and NEVER had anything bad. The duck was the only kind of \"regular\" thing, and the other person LOVED it (it was juicy, tender, prepped right... but the sauce was too mild for me--I want intense berry flavor; theirs was gentle and savory--overall the cost was the reason it\\'s only \"ok\" to me--expensive stuff and they use local goods as much as possible--what isn\\'t from scratch is from local companies like cucina fresca making a couple special pasta items for them).Anyway, my tired feet, aching back, usually did-too-much-today self always retreat here when I\\'m stuck in the emptiness that is downtown or Capitol Hill or Lake Union after hours. I have been only writing reviews that I think are needed. This... yeah. They deserve a chance. If you don\\'t like it, SEND IT BACK already. Get something else. They won\\'t be offended if they messed something up/it\\'s too tough or whatnot. They want to make you happy. Both late night managers are active in the prep of foods--they are hands on managers. I appreciate that a LOT. Our most frequent waiter, too, is just awesome, even though he seems kind of shy and is quite \"proper\" for Seattle. :) PS write comments ... they have paid attention to EVERYTHING I\\'ve said... and it\\'s been better (when ordering the same thing) each time. That\\'s a good sign, hmm?'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Mediocre at best, but ambiance and the booths are interesting. Breakfast food is my ultimate food. I can\\'t think of any meal more perfect. So for morning meal enthusiast, how does the house of 13 schillings stack up?To it\\'s credit, the service was prime, never did I have to repeat myself nor did I feel like the server wasn\\'t fulfilling what I expected of her. She was nice and knowledgable. The setting/ambiance of the restaurant is really nice. The booths are comfortable and the \"13 coins\" embedded into the table are a nice, be it obvious, touch. Where it falls short is the booth size, comfortable for two to dine but a group is standing room only. I do worry for Mister Fat Guy fitting in here.Another area it falls short is the food. While by no means disgusting, for the price there are other restaurants you can hit for better tasting food. I ordered the \"Spicy\" Italian Sausage Omelet. The sausage was savory but the \"Spice\" was pretty sub par, perhaps some cayenne pepper would have given it a much needed kick, the hash browns were soggy and honestly I\\'ve had better hash browns at a Denny\\'s at 3AM.In closing, give it a shot if you\\'re hungry at 3AM. but if you\\'re eating breakfast rather than raver dinner, go elsewhere. The price isn\\'t very nice and the food could use some work... and why oh why is the bathroom so damn cold?'},\n",

I asked for medium but got medium rare almost rare. but it's ok, i like rare steaks n all. but was sorta disapointed in not getting what i ordered. what if i was someone who didn't want that much red? the bread basket and sides are so random, i have no idea why you would eat bread butter and random pickled veggies. but regardless. something to munch on while we waitedmy prawns were delicious. wish they put more than one mushroom on my steak tho. i mean im paying 40something for the damn thing. lolmy boyfriend he got the steak, eggs and hashbrown plate. the hashbrowns are pretty darn good. the steak was yummy but didn't compare to my fillet mignon!so bottom line. good place to go to have a nice expensive dinner at whatever time you please since they're open 24 hours a day. but im not so sure if id make the trip again to visit this place. the bill was 66 bux and we left a 16 dollar tip making it total to 82 dollars for two people to eat. and we didn't get dessert or drinks. sorta pricey. but it was date nite. i wanted to try the place.i wasn't disappointed. food was good and i like our server. just some things don't match up. it reminds me of a sharis, but with better food quality and triple the price tag. lol\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'BADASS STEAK JOINT~Open 24 Hours A Day~This place reminds me of home. As a former Chicago girl, I grew up around these fabulous dark, 1950s/60s dinosaur steak joints that my grandpa favored. I always thought he was such a badass, taking me and my family out for a swanky steak dinner. In the dim light, I\\'d admire the way he knocked back 8 Captain and Cokes with his steak dinner as he barked orders at the waiter like a Camel-no-filter-fire-breathing dragon.Ah yes, &#160;I love the dark \"MAD MEN\" 60s gothic decor and I LOVE that this place is open 24 hours. Unfortunately, they have done a bit of remodeling in here, but the overall charm is preserved. And thank god the tall-backed brown leather booths are still the same. Except for the tragic loss of the coin-embedded old tables (replaced by a more generic cherry table wtf were they thinking???) this place remains the King of late night dinner in Seattle! &#160;The private booths are so welcome when you want a discreet, drunken dinner. And the crowd is always a fun mix of just about every sort of person from club kids to old timer drunks. The staff is consistently wonderful. They never keep you waiting and are always polite whether you are there at 8pm or 3 am. In fact, the staff is SO wonderful, it\\'s a little \"Twilight Zone.\" &#160;Definitely part of the charm.The menu can be a bit hit or miss.Hits: You can\\'t go wrong with the Philly sandwich or any of the pasta dishes. If you are not on a budget, have steak of course!!! Keep in mind, the food is as \"retro\" as the decor. Heavy, salty, delicious comfort food that is nearly extinct in ultra-healthy and ultra-hip Seattle. For breakfast I get the Eggs Benedict. The Canadian Bacon is always delish and they NEVER screw up the eggs. Just be sure to get the hollandaise on the side as sometimes they can pour too much on. Miss: Avoid things like the bay shrimp cocktail. A little too 60s even for me. The salads aren\\'t spectacular either. Needless to say, don\\'t bring your vegetarian friends here, they\\'ll just bitch and whine and ruin your meal. Although there are a lot of joints like this in Chicago, this is the only place like this in Seattle. Sadly, these types of places are a dying breed.'},\n",

As far as my husband remembers, it said \"one of the top 5 restaurants (it probably meant one of the top 5 24 hour open restaurants) in the United States.\" &#160;BUT, NO WAY!!!Everything was so disgusting.A Bowl of French onion soup: small, more than half the cup was a huge chunk of plastic-like highly-processed industrial cheese. The rest was overcooked and very salty and had little bit of onion.Spaghetti Bolognese (with meat sauce): the pasta was way &#160;overcooked. The source was watery and tasted like a canned sauce. There was almost no meat. &#160;(I could choose either meat sauce or meat ball so I chose meat sauce but what I got was something in between.)My husband ordered some other pasta as well. But after a couple of bites he refused to eat and we got refund for that pasta.According to him, who is Italian, the pasta was way overcooked and was completely tasteless while the source was way too salty and burnt, and he really couldn\\'t stand the taste and spit it out.I ate my food anyway because the senior waiter was nice and polite and I didn\\'t want to make him feel too bad because what had happened was not his fault and he had to apologize us anyway. But now I kind of regretted that I ate it.MAYBE this restaurant used to be a nice one.But not anymore.I really don\\'t recommend this place even for late at night.The quality is too bad to be called a \"restaurant.\"If you pay the same amount, get a room service from your hotel!'},\n",

The place seems too classy for shorts and a T-shirt, but probably not enough to require very formal wear. There is a complimentary appetizer dish of random finger foods (cherry tomatoes, etc).There is a minimum food purchase of $6 (?) per person! Sharing a dish will add an additional $2! As I already ate when I arrived, I got myself a manly Mangotini. Surprisingly, they did not skimp on the alcohol like many other restaurants would do. The glass was not wiped down apparently, as my fingers stuck to the mango-ness on the stem.There is a bar with happy hour, and there are live bands on certain days.They are open 24 hours a day, and yes they serve breakfast items all day. If you are looking to satisfy your steak and eggs needs, you might be better served at Denny's, where it would seem the quality is roughly the same (how can eggs be cooked differently?), but the price difference is much more noticeable.\"},\n",

The Escargot was good. It had a shrimp and clam taste that rested in a pool of oil and cheese.

At the downtown location, my sister had the audacity to declare this place the next \"Cracklas\" (see my review for Atlas Foods, R.I.P.)I, however, cannot bring myself to make such a declaration, unfortunately. Don\\'t get me wrong:- The hours are great (24-7, 365, no joke, all 365 days)- Breakfast served ALL DAY (Both times I had the Bacon &amp; Eggs)- The wait staff was attentive and made sure we were taken care of.- Sea-Tac\\'s location is RIGHT NEXT to the airport entrance!- Environment was great. The booths are ginormous! You walk in and feel like you should be about 200lbs heavier, with an unhappy/unfaithful wife at home, making 6-figures, and smoking a genuine cuban cigar while sipping some kind of expensive whiskey.The Sea-Tac\\'s location, the bacon was a little on the burned side, as were the hashbrowns. (To their credit, however, the hasbrowns are not greasy at all, which is just a preference of mine)I\\'m willing to go with the \"that was just a fluke\" theory for the Sea-Tac place. And maybe not being over the memories that Cracklas brought is haunting me.

It always seems like a good idea at the time and I have fond memories of the giant leather booths. Oddly enough I can never remember the food. Most recently, my drunken friend convinced me that we should \"live forever\" and stay up all night until dawn! Since there is little to do after 2 am in Seattle, a trip here seemed like a good idea. I ordered the French Dip. For what ever reason (A rat fell in the fryer?) they couldn\\'t make French Fries so I had to substitute hash browns instead. The sandwich was cold and on a soggy roll. I\\'m guessing it sat under the heat lamp too long. The hash browns were okay but not exactly what I was looking for to go with a French Dip. The Au Jus was hot at least. After a soda and tip and it came to over $20 for one of the least expensive items on the menu. Not exactly what we had in mind for late night grub. On the plus side it is 24 hours and if you\\'re willing to spend more then 13 coins you can get a decent steak or pasta. If your just looking for middle of the night chow, skip 13 Coins and head over to the Hurricane instead. Just as good at a fraction of the price.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'My sister and I were rolling around Seattle trying to find a late-night place to eat after a night of sight seeing. &#160;We went to all the usual digs which were completely filled up and parking was awful, so I google mapped the closest 24hour restaurant and this was what showed up.When they say \"24hour fine dining,\" they mean it.You start with a plate of meats, breads, cheeses and olives (which is $10 or something if you don\\'t buy an entree, but free if you do)Then you order off the menu that has stuffed chicken, filet mignon, etc.I had the filet, medium rare and it was amazing and cooked perfectly.My favorite part about this place was that the walls of the booths go alllll the way up to the ceiling, so privacy is almost guaranteed.All in all it was a good experience and I would definitely head back if I can save up some money because 24 hour fine dining comes with regular hour fine dining prices.Enjoy!'},\n",

       "  'text': \"I was given a $10 off coupon so I decided one night when I didn't feel like cooking to go have myself a meal. I was alone so I sat at the bar and watched the cooks make all of the dishes. It was pretty entertaining watching them work!When I sat down it took a bit longer than I would prefer for a waiter to acknowledge that I was there but once they did they were very attentive and friendly. I decided to try the Chicken Parmesan with cream cheese sauce. Not being a huge spaghetti fan I was hoping to sub mashed potatoes instead but apparently they had run out for the evening so when the waiter suggested hash browns or fries I went with fries. I love fries so I was ok with it but I suppose veggies may have been a better sub. Oh well, I liked it. The chicken parm was pretty tasty. That was the 1st time I have had it with a white sauce and I have to say they went well together. The chicken was nice and the sauce was done well, had a nice flavor to it. I had a few drinks with my meal and let me say the bartender wasn't stingy with the booze! I also tried the cheesecake. The flavor was nice enough but I generally prefer a thicker type of cheesecake.I really like the seating in here. The leather high backed seats and booths that seem more private. Seems to make it more cozy than your average restaurant. All in all 13 coins is definitely worth trying. Decent food even if it is a little pricey.\"},\n",

I came here with friends for a late night meal. &#160;We sat at the counter, which was cool because it allows us to watch them prepare your food and you can converse with the cooks.Since this was my first time here, I did not know what to order and asked one of the cooks what he recommended. &#160;He told me to go with the pesto pasta so I had to order that.It was interesting to watch him cook my meal because it reminded me on how the cooks at Cherry Street's pasta bar (at Seattle University) prepared their pasta. &#160;For those who are not familiar with CS's pasta bar, they toss in a serving of prepared noodles from a zip lock bag onto a heated skillet and toss in other ingredients. &#160;My pasta tasted hella good (mind you I had drinks prior) but it tasted fine when I ate the leftovers the next day.Now other two friends split the steak while one ordered the eggs benedict and the other had the country fried steak. &#160;They didn't like the steak so they had me try a bite of it. That had to be the grossest steak I've ever tasted! It tasted burnt and very bland. Good thing the pasta took the taste out of my mouth though.Basing off of my experience and reading other reviews, I would only eat here late at night and stick with the pasta for now.\"},\n",

       "  'text': '13 Coins should be part of the Myers Briggs test. You can definitely tell volumes about someone based on their reaction to this place.I used to come here with my dad for lunch when I was a kid during the summers when I\\'d \"help him at work\". As a kid I just loved being with dad and having a burger and fries there. The other place we went to was the Two Bells. At that time, nearly everyone who came to eat in these places wore ties and looked sharp. Since the 70\\'s the standards for this place have really gone down hill, however the culture of this town has changed even more since J.P. Patches and Stan Borreson ruled the Northwest.Local nostalgia aside, I can help sum this all up for you-- 13 coins is a great place to go to at 1am by yourself (don\\'t bring a date unless they\\'re drunk), and have eggs benedict or something while you wait for the effect of the coffee to kick in. This place isn\\'t overrated. I\\'ve never heard anyone say the food in this place is great. It\\'s just a haggard 24/7 joint where you can go sober up after your date has dumped you and/or if you\\'re too lazy to cook for yourself.To make your experience pleasant, pretend you\\'re a mobster with a lot of patience laundering some of your money through the manager. Nod your head up and down and wrinkle your lip and brow like Deniro in Goodfellas, finish your meal, wipe your mouth with the linen napkin, and go on your way to a nice little sleep...with the fishes!!!'},\n",

       "  'text': 'I\\'m always on the hunt for the next Brinner place (breakfast for dinner) and 13 is one of my favorite spots especially since it\\'s 24 hours. It\\'s dark, clean and inviting. if you\\'re counter side and listen well you can catch up on all the great stories the chefs spin while they flambe things to your hearts content. Anything with fire = good. I like to come here during \"the dark parade\", that in-between time just before the bars let out and four am but I\\'ve been known to pop in whenever. The waits are usually not too long at this time but can be hectic around the holidays or Friday nights but for the most part you can get a good seat and some great conversation in with no problem. They even have a large-party room and a separate lounge area that has live music on occasion. Kinda cool if you ask me.What I love: I can show up after a long night of studying in sweatpants with bedhead and and still get served like I\\'m a queen. Plus the waiters know just how much conversation needs to be said and when the hard drinks need to be poured. They\\'re on it with the drink refills and their dishes are hearty yet divine. You can usually feed two on one entree and the chefs don\\'t flinch at the word \"substitution\" like most other places. Sure, it costs a bit more than some places but you don\\'t have to be Oprah rich to get good hearty comfort food (I discovered this place as a poor art student mind you...)So yeah, when you feel like going out for a nice date or just want to get away with some friends and have some comfort food and good service, hop in to 13.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'While I have great late night memories of 13 Coins circa 9 years ago, I was disappointed by the breakfast I had there with friends recently. Our snooty server should have tipped us off to the mediocre experience that lay ahead, but we were hopeful. When my husband asked the server if the grapefruit or oj was fresh, his response was bordering on disgust as he said, \"No, man, it\\'s from a can\". I suppose the servers there don\\'t appreciate questions about the menu items...how rude of us! I asked for an eggs florentine without the egg, which i\\'ve done at many places and it\\'s never been a problem- should it be that much trouble to NOT cook an egg and put it on the plate?????? When my food arrived, the egg was there on the plate drowning underneath the overly oily and far too salty/lemony hollandaise sauce, sitting atop the sopping wet not at all crispy english muffin. As most people do, I adore the vintage over the top decor of 13 Coins, but the food has gone downhill and the service has most definitely followed. If you\\'re in the market for something tasty and sassy, I would suggest Glo\\'s Diner or Peso\\'s for a yummy breakfast in a fun atmosphere...sorry, 13 Coins- your service isn\\'t worth a dime.'},\n",

It was our anniversary and we wanted to start the day with breakfast, but we are late risers and didn't get around to the whole breakfast thing until noon. haha. So we thought of 13 Coins because they serve everything all day long! and we've been wanting to try it for a while.The atmosphere was quite nice. We got a high-back booth to ourselves and it was very cozy. Service was great. I got the eggs benedict and my bf got the seafood melt. He liked it, but it wasn't really my thing. My eggs benedict were not very impressive, especially for the price. Our 'breakfast' ended up being $60 (2 entrees &amp; a bloody mary). Definitely not stoked about that. I don't think the quality was worth the price, but they do have to charge a premium for 24hr dining! I may return to 13 Coins if I am barhopping in the area and crave some late night food, but I don't think I would necessarily plan on coming here. It is a place to check out though if you don't mind the price.Oh, and the bus-boy was fabulous. He's definitely not one of my friends or anything..... ; )\"},\n",

This was one of my father's favorite places in the 1970's - he has fond memories of a night out of drinking then coming here at 2AM for steak and lobster....I looked at their prices for the same item: $98.00. Um, no thanks. I'm not a cheap ass, but I'd question the quality of a $100/per person meal at 3AM. Nice to have as an option though. I'll let you know when I receive my black AMEX card. Although I'm kind of excited to bring my father back here, now that he's in Seattle again, so he can tell me what this place used to look like...I LOVE 70's designs! I'm crazy, but I'd take orange carpet, brown cabinets, and maybe even avocado green appliances...although it might just make me single for the rest of my life. Ha\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"Let me start with saying that I'm a huge fan of the 13 Coins by the airport. With that said this location doesn't match up in any terms. The last time I was here was by far the worst I've experienced. It wasn't any busier than you might expect for the time of day we were there but the service was exceptionally slow when it came to coming by our table for the initial greeting, subsequent drink order and eventually our food order. We were never offered refills of our beverages or asked if we wanted another for the drinks that applied to. Even after asking for more coffee I never received any.The food wasn't prepared quite right. It was definitely good but it wasn't great like I've come to expect from a 13 Coins. If the other late night options had been opened (they were closed for some odd reason) we wouldn't have come here that night and we would have been better off for it. I'll likely come back here when faced with similar circumstances but it will be with much distress and much lower expectations.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"13 Coins is unlike anywhere else I've been in Seattle. Honestly, it seems as if 13 Coins is caught in a time-space warp and got magically transported from Las Vegas - off-Strip. The clientele is so delightfully strange and the decor so oddly 1970s that if it weren't for a smoking ban, I would expect to hear slot machines in the background noise. There is probably not a better place for people watching, and we always leave wondering where these people are during the rest of the day. (I've seen them walk out the door, so it is not a magical place that traps in the oddness.) The strangeness of 13 Coins &amp; its atmosphere earn an extra star.That said, the food is more in the 3-star category. It is not bad. It is not the best food you are going to get in the city, particularly for the price, but where else can you get chicken marsala at 3am? Not many places. The menu is as diverse and strange as the place itself. There is a full bar (sit in there on weekend nights for extra diversity), and the drinks are not underpoured, which surprised me a little. There is nothing else anywhere I've lived like 13 Coins, and that is a shame. Then again, it really does seem one-of-a-kind.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'Ever since I read a description of them in a history book in elementary school, I\\'ve been kind of obsessed with Hangtown Frys. I am lucky to live in the San Francisco Bay area and near one of the best at the Tadich Grill.. that\\'s kind of the gold standard, but I\\'m pretty forgiving when it comes to this dish.Nonetheless, its surprising how rare they are, so I can\\'t resist ordering one whenever I see it on the menu. So on a recent trip to Seatlle, I was wandering around the Pike Place market after picking up pastries and jam from the ethereal Le Panier (that\\'s for another review) and was happily surprised when I saw Hangtown Fry on the menu board at The Athenian Inn. The Athenian is a place I would generally avoid--a tourist-trappy place with a lot of \"character\" and a nice view--but like I said, I couldn\\'t resist, so I went in and ordered. It was really beyond awful: imagine a singed, soggy omelette with leftover breaded oysters that had turned and rancid bacon. After forcing down two bites, I tried to get the taste out of my mouth with swigs of the cafeteria-grade coffee. I was pretty pissed at myself for ignoring my instincts and going in there, but mostly I was disappointed at not getting at least an edible version of a favorite dish. To eradicate the memory, I was determined to find a better one before I left Seattle. So I went to yelp and came up empty except for 13 Coins. The reviews on 13 Coins were average, but I decided to give it a shot for breakfast the next morning. The place is a throwback to those clubby Italian-American restaurants of the 60\\'s and is kind of intimidating with its dim lighting and dark leather booths, but I settled into one of the gigantic captain\\'s chairs in front of the grill and ordered my fry. Since it was breakfast I subbed hashed browns for the spaghetti. I was encouraged as I saw them competently assembling the other breakfasts. I watched the cook empty a huge mound of grated potatoes onto one end of the grill to transform magically into hashed browns. They made my fry and put it into the overhead broiler to brown. I was getting excited. It was wonderful. The oysters were big, fresh and juicy; the bacon thick and in balance; the eggs set just perfectly. The fry at Tadich is thinner, crispier, and more like a frittata, but 13 Coins definitely delivered an excellent version. More importantly, they provided salvation from the earlier horrible experience and I left Seattle happy. (They did charge me a couple of extra bucks to sub the hashed browns, but those were really good too, so it was cool.)'},\n",

I guess this is yet another example of me being my own worst enemy! This place is FANTASTIC! Its somehow managed to capture the old school dinner feeling and yet kick up to high end dinning. I did not venture to the back area where the T.V. was so, I wont speak on it. I was too busy tripping over the seats and booths in the front half near the grill. There are a lot of people who refuse to sit at the bar or near the grill. Whats up with that? Its one of the best seats in the house and you can talk to you cook, see what hes doing, its great. The seats at the bar make you feel like you are a super villain! All you need is to be stroking a cat or something as you spin around in these high back leather chairs. The booths are equally as comfortable but somehow manage to be cut off from everyone else because they are so deep. Its like you have your own world when you sit in them. The food...this place defines comfort food. The fact that they are there 24/7 only adds to this place being truly a hidden gem. I started with the calamari...of course and ended with the chicken scalapini. The calamari was good but, not as much so as the Capital Grille down on 4th...sorry. However, the scallapini was amazing and the only thing I can say is more chicken next time! I simply could not find much to dislike about this place and would HIGHLY recommend it just for the seating alone!'},\n",

My first visit, I ordered their fish and chips, soup of the day and a drink. All of which added up to a $30 + tip bill. The fish was okay, the fries were cold (as if they had been sitting in the bin for a while) and about the only thing that saved that lunch was the soup and the crunchy piece of bread that came with it. My second visit, was an order for breakfast. I can\\'t recall if it was french toast or a waffle... obviously neither was memorable enough to recall. And my latest visit was for the country fried steak and eggs. I was missing my toast, my eggs were cold and the country fried steak was no where near as crunchy as a fried steak should be. Soggy would actually be a better word at the moment. The gravy was good but not anything to rave about. Hash browns were crunchy on top, soggy on the bottom. And for some reason there was an orange slice underneath my country fried steak.. Which threw off the flavor some. I didn\\'t get my toast and I was charged 3.95 for a \"Large\" apple juice that really looked like a tall cup of coffee at starbucks. I work right next door to 13 coin, and I made it a point to walk over there at precisely the right time so that I could enjoy my food piping hot. Even arriving on time for pickup of my to go food didn\\'t work out. You would think that the third time would be a charm.. Not so much. 1 star for being close to my work and saving me when I needed something to eat. And another one star for mediocrity, and that is already charity in itself.'},\n",

Im not a cheapo, but for what you pay, you would expect that the food wouldn\\'t be so bland. One thing that sticks out in my mind the most though, was the Chicken Fried Steak. I read rave reviews and things saying that \"the gravy was to die for.\" I had high hopes, but the dish was completely flavorless. And the gravy.. I felt like i was eating sludge. Uhh yeah... &#160; The best thing i have eaten here though is \"The believer\" which is Chicken Parmigiana w/ pasta and instead of marinara, they use white sauce. They probobly think they are being different so i guess thats why they put the 20 dollar price tag on it, but its really not THAT special. I will give it to them though. The deep fried ice cream is freakin DELISH! It has a white hazelnut(i think) cream all over two huge scoops of fried vanilla ice cream. Mmmm! Aztecas fried ice cream can\\'t even compare!My last visit here a couple weeks ago was very disappointing. Came in and they said that they were doing maintenance in the kitchen, and the only thing available was the cold food (salad) WTF! Might as well close down shop! sheesh.I don\\'t hate this place.

He spent so much time serving the every petty need of one table, that he ignored me completely. After taking my drink and food order, I waited 15 minutes for a gin and tonic. Then had to ask 10 minutes later where my food was, none of which even had to be cooked. I had ordered a salad and shrimp cocktail. When it arrived the salad had if course been sitting drowning in dressing for about 20 minutes. Then my bill was wrong: he had not charged me happy hour prices but full price. Luckily he fixed it, but either tis guy was new, totally incompetent or having the worst night of his life. Not sure when I will return.'},\n",

It wasn\\'t just the lame, inattentive waiter though, that wouldn\\'t have been a big deal, &#160;it\\'s that they have all these AAA awards and BS and think they can get by on that and awful food.

Manager Angela: Well does the customer know where clams come from?! I over heard all of that and wanted to give her a piece of my mind, but I held myself back. They replaced it. Still tasted like shit. Then the most funniest thing happened I thought at least, one of the servers gave a table the wrong dish and that customer sent it back and told the manager and the manager shouted \"OH SHIT\"! hahahahaha everyone paused and looked at her and then she corrected herself and said \"OH SHOOT\".

The hostess was very friendly and we waited about 25min to be seated. We were excited and hungry to be here because the last time we ate here it was great. We ordered our food shortly after we were seated, got our drinks about 5min later, 30min come and still no food. The server comes and gives us a two dishes deviled eggs and salami/veg tray and said he apologize for the wait and it would take a little while longer for the food to come. We literally ate these two plates in record time, waiter comes back to check and ask if we wanted more and we said no because its been almost an hour now and the food surely would be out soon. BIG MISTAKE, it did not come out until another hour later. The food did not come out all together, one person's order came out 15min before everyone else's and he was practically done while we were waiting for the rest. A manager finally approached our table and asked if we were ok, we asked why it took so long for our food to come out and I was extremely hungry and irritable at this point. The best explanation was that they were busy and claims they had every cook working in the kitchen, obviously not because if they did the food would have been out way earlier. So the food, hmmm, well it was not worth the wait. I ordered the omellete with the seafood and it didn't taste that great, in fact it had no taste. The rest of the others food was ok I assume as the long wait already dampered the situation. Since we waited 2hours for &#160;our food we assumed we were going to be compensated for something anything but no. We never were offered to get our coffee/juices comped. What a waste of time and Christmas morning, the manager at that time I felt like he didn't do no more then offer an explanation which I could have gotten from someone on the street, it was just not sincere and seemed like he didn't care because they were just busy. OK I understand your busy but to wait for two freakin hours is ridiculous and on top of that we weren't really given a time frame so we wouldn't have to sit there in misery and could have gone elsewhere. It was overall a lousy experience and I regret that our time was truly WASTED.\"},\n",

The appetizers we choose were the bruschetta and the 13 Coins fries with dipping sauce. The bruschetta was possibly the best bruschetta I've ever had. One appetizer came out before the other, which the server apologized for. We selected the chicken parmigiana and the half Benedict for our entrees. The chicken parmigiana was good, although the chicken was a little too crispy and the dish was a little too cheesy for me. The half Benedict was very good, but there was not enough of the very tasty sauce. While we'd like to visit again, we don't think it is in the cards.

I\\'ve been here before in the dining room area and have always had good, attentive and friendly service. Tonight was not the case. In fact, it was quite the opposite! Maybe it was cause we sat in the lounge area. What a bad decision that was... honestly, we should have waited that 15 minutes to sit in the dining room. Now I know. So we sat ourselves in the lounge. It was super dark and there was live music, not horrible. So we wait... and wait... and wait... We finally get some dinner menus and order our drinks. The drinks came out quick, but the water stayed on the bar for a good 10-15 minutes. WTH! It should be the FIRST thing you serve customers. The server said it\\'d be right out, but she passed it a few times and didn\\'t even care to bring them. I usually wouldn\\'t be this PO\\'d about not getting water... but I was super dehydrated! C\\'mon now! Anywho, we finally get our water and she took our order. **NOTE** The prices have definitely increased over the years, I\\'m not sure their food quality is worth the sticker shock. It was also happy hour at the time. So then we wait....and wait...and wait..,.,This lounge is seriously understaffed... it was ONE waitress for a good 10 parties or so. It took RIDICULOUSLY long to get ANYTHING. Need to get her attention? Good luck on that....So we finally get our food. Monte Cristo, I didn\\'t try it. A frittata, was super bland. Farmers omelette, also super bland. My HH meatball sliders on cibatta was very good though. Worthy of the two stars I gave. The boys needed condiments for their super bland food.. but while waiting, the food just got cold. Eventually I was able to flag down a manager (I think) and got the boys their stuff. The food already sucked at that point. We also ordered two beers, which they forgot. I had to remind them 3 times. Oh! And the waitress didn\\'t even know what beers were on tap, because she didn\\'t know what \"being on tap\" meant! So frustrating. So after the 4th inquiry on our beers... the manager decided it was funny to bring the two beers to the table and go \"BAM!\". Sorry, I\\'m not impressed by your magical skills to get beers to appear 20 minutes later. Also, if you tell me the beers are being poured as we speak.. make sure I can\\'t see the bar as it is clear no one was pouring anything.We finally finish and are able to leave at 1:30am.

We were about to order an item, and as we were mentioning it, the waiter mentioned that it was not very good that night, and gave us some lovely helpful suggestions for what was good that evening! and... let me tell you. Our food was absolutely amazing! If you have any question based off the negative comments on the food quality on yelp. JUST ASK THE WAITER. They are wonderful with suggestions, and they don't JUST recommend the most expensive thing on the list.Also, even though it was 2am, they staffed for it. We got our meal quite promptly! 2nd time we went. It was early afternoon, we were dressed... um.. not so nice (Him in black car-harts and a hoodie, and me in t-shirt/yoga pants haha!). &#160; Although I was concerned our service would not be as excellent, I was proven wrong. We still got treated like KINGS! After that, we were hooked. We always expect amazing service, and receive it every.single.time.We tip our waiters very well for their amazing service.Yes, the place is pricey for most. But, if you can afford it, you NEED to eat here, or at LEAST try it!\"},\n",

I'm not sure if it's because they're open 24 hours and by the time 3 am rolls around they've probably had enough bullshit pass through, but If life is that miserable you should probably quit. I have been 3 times, twice at night and once during the day. Both night services were horrible. The first time, the man waiting on us acted as if we had woken him up and asked him to make us dinner. Life couldn't of been more miserable for him at that point. It was 3 am, we tried to understand the drunk rush was probably no fun. The 2nd time, the lady serving us was rude and sharp and probably the least helpful being in the restaurant. Even after, all that she messed up on our bill and even when i waited the extra half hour for her to acknowledge us, I eventually just trecked up front to see if someone else could take care of my bill. Of course, they couldn't so, i had to wait another 20 min for her to come over and even then she mumbled some bullshit about the bill and came back with the exact same bill. At that point, I was more tired than anything and didn't want to deal with the overcharge. I don't recommend this place at night, maybe if you're eating at the lounge, but def not the restaurant part. You're better off grabbing a bite at Hurricane Cafe and dealing with the transients than sitting in a overpriced, sub-par facility with shit service.\"},\n",

The 1st time I had a good experience with a nice, friendly waiter - making the cost of the meal ok (with gas prices these days who wants to drive out of town?). But the last 2 times I had the same waiter (an Asian guy who makes you feel like you're just a waste of his time for even showing up in his area) - who basically made a helluva good night turn crappy. The 1st time we had him for our waiter, we thought it was a fluke as he was training some poor soul and acted as if the guy could do no right. The 2nd time (just this Saturday) that we had the misfortune of having him again, it was just him - and his attitude STINKS! I had friends from out of town, and that just put a bad taste in their mouth, and they hadn't even eaten yet. He'd cut us off when we talked, quickly drop stuff at the table and run off before even seeing if we had what we needed, was so quick to take orders that he got one of my friends orders wrong and never came back (after plunking it down and running) until the mgr came by 1/3 of her way into the meal to ask how we were doing (he took it off the bill, which was nice). It's as if this guy got shafted at another place he worked and now just really hates his life having to serve people, even people who try to be nice. &#160;I will not return to 13 Coins to be mistreated like that. We weren't obnoxious, we weren't rude. He's the type of guy you want to yell at but also don't want him to go back in the kitchen and spit in your food before serving you. He also closely looked at our receipts (the tip portion, no doubt) while we were still sitting there. And yeah, $6.50 per person charge just to sit there?! wtf?! I'm done with this place, I'll pay that in gas to get out of Seattle to go somewhere else that has a 24 hr restaurant! Oh - the food? Who cares about the food when the service REEKS!\"},\n",

The menu and selection looked nice, but some items seemed way over priced. Do they fly their food in from France or something? Jeez. Our waiter, I'm pretty sure, was a robot. This proto-type apparently has no ability to make facial movements, just a blank stare. Wonder when the next upgrade will come out.

The sides were delicious: simple spinach with a ton of garlic (sorry, co-workers), thick fries piled like Jenga pieces, and (my favorite) sauteed mushrooms. The waitress was wonderful. As we hummed and hawed over a couple of different wines, she brought us a little of each to try.The 13 Coins is NOT cheap. Steak entrees are $30+. Also, for such a traditional steakhouse, you'd think they'd have mashed potatoes, but no (steaks come with a side of pasta which the waitress was kind enough to whisk away for me).

       "  'text': 'When I travel out-of-town on business, I usually try to eat somewhere local (not a national franchise). &#160;I have had many good experiences and a few unfortunate ones, as well.I was in Seattle on business not too long ago and was looking for a place for dinner, preferably close to the hotel (in the Downtown/Queen Anne area). &#160;I did what any other road warrior would do first - I checked online. &#160;I had been at 13 Coins many years earlier (the SeaTac location) and saw that the downtown location was only a few blocks away. &#160;An easy walk!Of course, I also read the reviews. &#160;Many people swear by this place, others say it is overpriced, and some do not like it at all. &#160; But I decided to give it a try and see for myself.It was a weeknight around 7:30 PM. &#160;The restaurant was not particularly busy and there were many booths and tables open. &#160;When I went to the hostess to get seated and said \"table for one\", she immediately directed me to the counter. &#160;I asked if I could have one of the empty tables instead. &#160;She mumbled something I could not quite make out, but it sounded like \"this is all that is available right now\".I told her I was not in a hurry and could wait for a table. &#160;There were several empty ones and it seemed like there were enough wait staff to handle the room. &#160;Then I heard her say \"we only seat single parties at the counter\". &#160;What??To be fair, the counter seats are these comically large designs with wrap-around wings on either side so you have some degree of privacy from your \"neighbor\". &#160;But I find counter service to be less than relaxing - maybe that is just me. &#160;At the counter, you end up staring at the back of the bar or get dragged into an adjacent conversation. &#160;I just wanted someplace I could have a quiet dinner, read the paper, and relax. &#160;But 13 Coins apparently has a policy that prohibits diners from sitting at a table or booth if there are by themselves.I thanked the hostess and told her I would go somewhere else for dinner. &#160;I turned around and walked out. &#160;That did not bother her in the least and she did not try to change my mind by offering a table instead of a counter seat. &#160;I am sure this policy stems from the fact that someone at 13 Coins figures tables with 2 or more spend more money and tip the wait staff more. &#160;That may be, but when there are tables and booths that are empty on a Tuesday night, when there are available wait staff &#160;to serve those tables, and when there are no reservations or large parties for that evening, the policy seems to make little sense.I have traveled across the US and internationally and have been fortunate enough to dine at a variety of restaurants - from 5-star to local dives. &#160;But in none of these have I ever been denied a seating preference. &#160;I have gladly waited a short while in some cases, but I was never told \"you can only eat here (counter).\"This 13 Coin policy is not really discriminatory, because it apparently applies to all single diners. &#160;But in this economy, turning a customer away because of a silly policy is simply not good business. &#160;As a result, whenever I am in Seattle, I will not spend my money at 13 Coins and urge other single business travelers to do the same. &#160;There are many other good choices out there and many other restaurants that seem to be perfectly fine with having a customer sit at a table by themselves.'},\n",

       "  'text': \"24-hour joints always excel at one thing-- Breakfast food-- and 13 coins is no different. This locale served myself and my parterns-in-crime (in scrubs) well after a night shift. Though they had run out of my first-choice quiche (evidently there is a breakfast rush here that dissipates around 8:45am), my waffle came with fresh fruit on the side and an enormous amount of whipped cream and berries on top. I made it smile in the photo uploaded to Yelp, to reflect my opinion of the waffle. Service was labile-- why a small wait for a booth when there were 4 open already? And, one of our party ordered Irish Coffee, the other a Mimosa-- yet 2 Irish coffees came out. However, our waiter was friendly, the food was fresh and filling, and the booths were comfortably (and evidently designed for giants). The location is easily accessible, once you realize that the giant sign is pointing to the (free) parking lot off of Denny, not the actual restaurant. Maybe I was simply too bleary-eyed to see the front entrance at first, but I got a little turned around trying to find my way in. The bathrooms were clean, with a couch in the Ladies' room. I'm sure I'll find my way back here, but I'm not in any hurry with so many better places around. Bottom line-- 5 stars for food and convenience, 3 stars for service and being a bit pricy.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'chicken fried steak. enemy of the thighs, but much beloved by the taste buds, i had turned a blind stomach toward this savory treat for far too long. three dehydrated and hungry girls set out for brunch following a late night method man and redman concert, and after i spied this item on the menu, i would look no further. it arrived crispy and hot, smothered in a luscious bacon gravy, perched beside my over-medium eggs and crunchy hashbrowns. while eating it more than once a year might or might not require a triple bypass, the rich breakfast treat was exactly the calorie-laden start to my day that i needed. one of my girlfriends got the italian sausage omelet, filled to the brim with chunks of yummy, fennell-filled italian sausage, peppers and onions, and bubbly cheese; and the other stuck with a traditional scrambled eggs and bacon. i had bites of both and they were excellent. they rounded out the meal by splitting a waffle with ice cream on top, and i finished up with the mixed berry parfait. and yes, we ate EVERYTHING. after the cook sent out the food, we heard him mutter from behind the counter, \"now THOSE are customers.\" 13 coins is almost impossible to find, and isn\\'t much to look at from the outside. but inside, it\\'s is all dark wood and leather, high-backed booths and counter stools that look more like thrones, and the food is tasty and affordable. our server was funny and impressed by our eating prowess, and told us the story of how the restaurant got its name: there\\'s an old peruvian tale about a boy who was in love with the chief\\'s daughter and wanted her hand in marriage. all he had to offer was 13 coins, but he loved her so much that the chief decided it was enough. and just like the chief who gave the poor peruvian boy a chance, you too should look past a shabby exterior and see the mouthwatering goodness that lies within.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'If you eat here when not plastered and starving at 3 AM, then you\\'re a nutcase. This place is meant for drunken, late night, \"I didn\\'t hook up so I want some food,\" grazing. Depending on how drunk you are, the place can take on a David Lynch-like environment with a bizarre assortment of folks from all walks of life and in various stages of intoxication from both legal and not so legal sources. I admit that the food is less than stellar but again, you\\'re drunk and it\\'s 3 AM. You\\'d eat roadkill and Cheetos at this point. I recommend sticking with the omelet family of late night dining options. It\\'s hard to screw up an egg. So, if you were drinking until the barback pulled the glass from your frantic lips at last call, and Dick\\'s is closed and the sausage street vendors (What is up with the cream cheese on those anyway?) have packed up for the night, go to 13 coins. It beats cannibalism or that wicked hangover you\\'ll have when you come to if you don\\'t eat. Plus, the people watching is a can\\'t miss.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'I went here late at night on saturday evening with the intention of getting great food and supposedly great autmosphere. Boy was I misled. When I walked in with my sister we were sat by a waiter named Joe. He was the most pompass rude self absorbed person i have ever met in my life. I work in the restaurant field as an assistant general manager and would not even let this kind of waiter scrub the bathrooms. He leaned in like he was gods gift to waiters ( totally invading our space) and ask in a tone that expressed that he really had better things to do ( like sit with all the other help at the front and gossip about this or that, and asked if we wanted something to drink. I asked for water with lemon and my sister decided on a gin and tonic, &#160;all water basically. He came back with a water that had no ice and no lemon and acted so put off when i asked for some ice and the lemon i previously asked for. after 5 minutes he brought me my ice but forgot the lemon once again. He left then came back 10 minutes later to ask for our food order. I ordered the smoked chedder burger medium cooked and my sister had the petit new york well http://done.it took 20 minutes for our food to come out and my sister really enjoyed her steak. I myself got 2 pieces of bacon that were most definently microwaved and asked the manager on duty to please replace it. She brought me one piece of bacon instead of two and did not offer an appology. This was the worst service that I have ever had in a place that has high prices and poor service. If there was an option to give this place a negative rating i would. Whoever is the general manager they should reconsider who they allow to serve and manage on there late night shift. If they worked for me I would have fired Joe on the spot. I will never come back to this restaurant and will strongly encourage all my friends in that area to do the same. Do yourself a favor if your thinking of this place to eat SAVE YOUR MONEY.'},\n",

The French onion soup was really good; Everything I love about the soup was done perfectly; The soup, the bread, and the cheese on top. The hanger frittata was bad, though. It was the oyster and bell pepper one, and it came with pasta (spaghetti with a little parm and parsley). The pasta and frittata weren't complimented by any type of sauce, so it was a very dry eating experience. I would've felt very ripped off had I been the one to pick up the bill.

My review writing skills are a bit rusty, to say the least.But really, I had breakfast with my favorite brunch buddy this past Saturday at the 14 Carrots Cafe in Eastlake and enjoyed the entire experience. Well, I didn\\'t appreciate whomever used the women\\'s restroom before me - Thanks for peeing on the seat lady!In an effort to unearth my beach body for my upcoming trip to Australia I\\'m on a diet of beans, veggies, and protein (meat). So going into brunch I was curious as to what I\\'d be able to eat that would get me all of the above without having to be \"that person\" who asks for a million substitutions. Enter the heuvos rancheros! 14 Carrot\\'s classic heuvos rancheros starts with a crisp flour tortilla which is layered with tender black beans, onions, cheese, and two luxuriously fried eggs; accompanied by hash browns, fresh salsa, and a side of sour cream. In order to adhere to my absurd diet, I ate all the black beans, eggs, salsa, and a minimal amount of the hash browns and tortilla. Everything was delicious! My friend had two pancakes, which were made with cottage cheese, covered in warm syrup. You can\\'t go wrong with carbs, saturated fat, and high fructose corn syrup in the morning.Another thing I really liked about 14 Carrots are their mimosas and coffee cart. First the coffee. Like a conjoined fetus, there\\'s a small coffee cart attached to the front of the small cafe that sticks out onto the sidewalk, where passerby can buy a morning joe, and where they make their specialty beverages for the diners. Second, the mimosas! I had three. What!? It\\'s brunch, and I didn\\'t stuff myself with food, and, well, shut it! I digress. These mimosas are actually strong - \\'nough said.All-in-all, a great dining experience. I will definitely be back to 14 Carrots.ENJOY!'},\n",

A few weeks before we decided to go out to do this he told me that he wanted to treat both I and another friend of mine to a breakfast on him, but since this morning I was the only one who could make it we ended up with only two people on the bill. My pal ordered a hashbrown with egg breakfast that had some ham on the side, with an esspresso and then I ordered a simple hashbrown and egg breakfast which I had chosen to pair with both a cappuccino and a Mike's Hard Lemonade to drink because when it came time to order I was feeling like I was in a low key yet self indulgent mood.

       "  'text': \"I came here on a Thursday for brunch/lunch after spending the morning working at Voxx cafe next door. I chose to go for the huevos rancheros which were consisted of two fried eggs on corn tortillas with ranchero sauce and black beans. Their ranchero sauce was subtle in flavor but the with all the other elements made the overall dish good. It was served with hashbrowns which were practically pan-fried julienned potatoes, but hey, anything fried is yummy! Speaking of which, their corn tortillas were deep fried which was nice because I don't like the awkward texture of corn tortillas that kind of crumble in your mouth. Usually I prefer refried beans when eating Mexican food but for something meant to be possibly eaten in the morning, the black beans were not too heavy while not being watery and gross. &#160;The menu is very extensive and I will definitely have to come back to give a full report of the food. I am looking forward to trying their french toast and other omelettes (a greek one with feta was my other option). Part of the reason I enjoyed coming here was the outdoor seating and the fact that I could sit and work while I waited for my food since they had free wireless. The service was also very friendly and neighborhoody (if that were a word).\"},\n",

Asked if I could order a sandwich to go, since I was on my way back to work and didn\\'t have time to hang out. Was given a mechanically-dispensed list of options for my sandwich and side, then left alone with no further comment and no offer to take a seat until it was ready. Just left to hang out at the front door and look awkward. Watched my hostess-slash-server melt her ice to chat up one regular, then say \"hi sweetie\" to another. Decided to go outside and grab some coffee.Coffee Cart Guy(tm) did his best to make small talk while he pulled my shots, and was friendly enough. Offered to let me pay for my coffee inside on my lunch bill. Also told me that once I was back inside I was welcome to sit at any open table while they finished my sandwich. Made a DAMN FINE vanilla latte, sure, but $3.50 for an 8oz? Really? $3.50??Went back into the cafe and took a seat at the table with the magazines, enjoyed my coffee, and waited for my sandwich. Took longer than it should\\'ve, given what I ended up with, but this isn\\'t a big sticking point. What does kill me, however, is that I got back to my desk and opened my container to find that my Avo-Turkey sandwich -- which was supposed to contain turkey, avocado, lettuce, mayo, and tomato -- was given to me sans tomato. The fuck. The bread they use is reeeeaaally good sandwich bread, so I\\'ll pretend the one obligatory star Yelp forces me to dole out is for that. However, there is absolutely no reason I should have paid $8.50 for an amazingly basic sandwich and a side of tough pasta salad with a grossly tangy aftertaste, let alone for those things with no tomato.All in all, I see absolutely no reason to go back, even if I happen to be starving and walking by. I don\\'t care if they call you \"sweetie\" after they finally decide they like you. I\\'m not going to overpay them on a regular basis for the privilege.Coffee bar: 3 stars.Cafe: 1 star.Overall: Double \"Meh.\"'},\n",

Spinach in curry, spinach with balsamic vinegar, wilted spinach with Korean sauce, all are splendid, but raw spinach just frightens me. As fast as I can, I get it into a pan with some oil and salt and garlic, and if I find when I think about it afterwards that in fact I'm not even hungry, well, I can always put it in the fridge with the refried beans, and make quesadillas with it later.And then there is spinach salad.Spinach salad, reason proclaims, must be made out of raw spinach.And it is good.And I think to myself that I should make it.And even sometimes do I purchase some spinach, and some bacon and other requisite items, and even do I bear them home to my dwelling, whereupon--I stir-fry the spinach and make some rice and fry up bacon, and there I am again, saladless.Rarely can I think of a very good reason to go out to eat, but spinach salad is one such reason. Into the mysterious recesses of a restaurant kitchen goes raw spinach, and out it comes, transfigured, and I get to eat it, and then I am happy.Unless it's at 14 Carrots. There, you order a spinach salad and what you get is a big pile of raw spinach, in all its fearsomely glistening velvety green glory. Adorned with a little pile of raw mushrooms, to boot.\"},\n",

At first glance, the staff looks like they know what they're doing; that's just the vibe I got. I couldn't have been more wrong, I especially hate it when I feel like I'm inconveniencing a server by having to remind them about simple things.

I'm not sure of my food was cold when it came out like some here have claimed; but it sure as shit was after I was finally able to take a bite of it.I also got coffee there, while it tasted good, it was only filled twice. I'm not going to go into a Mr. Pink-style rant about this; but Jesus F'ing C, I see you wandering around with the coffee pot, why not come over and put some of that love in my cup!? Oh I know, it must be like at a carnival or fair, I have to hit ya' in the head with my cup and win the refill... is that it?Over-priced, shitty service and mediocre food.

I told her we'd wait outside (there being no place to wait inside). When the table was available, it sat untended to for another 10 minutes. She then came out and told me that she had been calling my name, as if the delay in my seating were my fault...ha.We were finally seated and it took another 10-15 before anyone even greeted us and asked for drinks. I grabbed a mimosa which came out another 45 minutes later with our food.The food was mediocre. I got the huevos rancheros. Eggs were good. Wasn't a fan of the fried tortillas (in lieu of the traditional soft corn tortillas), but that's just a preference. Also, was not impressed with the store bought, Pace-esque salsa. The hashbrowns were epic, although it's rare that a side will salvage a dish for me.Granted, this place was packed. I was hoping they were just having an off day, but the service and the food have consistently disappointed. Also, weekend brunch is the name of the game at this business; hence, they need to up the ante with their service and product. The staff is very friendly.

       "  'text': \"These are the best &#160;restaurant huevos rancheros that I've had - crispy corn tortillas (the toasted nature is key!) with stewed tomatos/black beans and a generous serving of cheddar cheese topped with fried eggs. &#160;They could be a little more generous with the pico de gallo and sour cream, which are served on the side, but overall, the combination of the core part of the entree is impeccable. &#160;Side of hashbrowns is your average shredded potato (hard to distinguish if they are frozen or not) but overall this is a kickass neighborhood breakfast and it is great to avoid the wait at so many other places during peak brunch times. &#160;The salmon eggs benedict is also quite enjoyable.Everything else is, as others said, average, but definitely good enough if you're looking for a basic weekend breakfast. &#160;Ironically I've been told while there that the carrot cake is nothing remarkable!Word to the wise: I had a pretty negative experience with my cinnamon bun there this morning. &#160;It's one of those things that, sadly, the big chain does best: Cinnabon's cream cheesy frosting that smothers a hot bun has set a gold standard that 14 Carrot's giant but comparitively very dry version just didn't seem to meet.All-in-all, though, that pretty darn amazing huevos rancheros offering merits my four star rating, even if it's the only thing I ever order there again.\"},\n",

I think the price is fair to good. You can get farmer style breakfasts and pancakes and stuff for as low as $7-8, and on the other end there are daily specials that can run &#160;to about $13-14.

The b-fast menu is extensive and includes the standards (waffles, eggs and toast, etc) as well as some lovely scrambles and omelets that are inspired by the owners \\'old country\\' - Greece. These more unusual items were the most tempting to me: scrambles w/ avocado, or olives, sausage, artichokes or sun dried tomato... All sounds pretty great to me.We ordered the same thing: pesto eggs benedict - and they were pretty much outrageous. The pesto that replaced the classic hollandaise tasted homemade and was the perfect topping to the roasted pepper, spinach, ham and poached egg on an english muffin. Yum. Just writing this is inspiring me to return. Soon. The owner dropped by our table to chat and exited with a chipper: \"better than turkey, huh?!\" - it was Thanksgiving. And it was better than turkey. Way better, &#160;in my humble opinion. (Sorry, Uncle Mike, that turkey was a little dry this year.)The egg dishes came with hashbrowns that were kindof ribboned. They were classic, tasty, and pure potato (no onions messin\\' around in there). Finally, the dish was also accompanied by a little fruit plate the likes of which you haven\\'t seen in a \\'greasy-spoon type diner\\' ever! Fresh, varied, all ripe and good- I know. Bizarre. Not just a garnish but a dessert/palate cleanser/real-healthy side plate!Stumble in here when you want savory breakfasts that are unique, filling and oh-so-good.

If you request onions or anything additional on your order to go, be sure and check for it before leaving, or you may be disappointed. &#160;Also, the prices on the menu are prohibitive to the many office workers on the block and there are no advertised specials. As a result they must find their lunch food at Eastlake Market, Subway or $3.00 slices at Pazzos\"},\n",

Running some errands in SODO we happened upon 1st Ave Deli Mart. I hear him flip on the blinker as he pulls into this forgettable parking lot in front of a shabby building with bars on the windows. Thinking he was lost I asked him what he was thinking. Suddenly with a huge smile on his face he says, \"No... I\\'ve been here before and totally forgot how awesome it was. It\\'s a market that sells amazing, cheap banh mi!\"Still doubtful, we exit the car, pass a homeless man loitering outside and walk in. Some shelves are empty, I notice fridges of Gatorade, Coke products, beer, and the usual stuff. We nab a few Powerades and head to the main counter. Above the Lottery signs there\\'s a menu. I let him order and the woman behind the counter stopped what she was doing and made some sammies for us. She was extremely friendly and relatively quick as well. When the food was done she smiled and thanked us for coming in. Instead of opting for a table inside, we left to eat at home.So why am I writing about this place for my 1,000th review? Because 1st Ave Deli is what Yelp is all about. Finding and sharing those hidden gems. From the road this market was totally forgettable. It didn\\'t look nice, it didn\\'t look special, hell - it didn\\'t look open! But we pulled up, walked in, and were served the freshest, cheapest banh me I\\'ve had in a long time. So yeah, maybe most people come here to buy cigarettes or Donettes, but if you look on Yelp to find the best banh mi in Seattle, this place ought to come up in the search results. I\\'ll keep eating here for sure!'},\n",

To find it, you probably want to be entering the &#160;Court House on a somewhat voluntary basis via the front door. It will be on your right, just after the metal detectors. If you're one of the folks in the orange jumpsuits being transferred from detention, this place is likely to escape your notice. It's sort of a combination cafe and store. There are some supplies for sale as you enter the establishment. There are coolers with sandwiches, drinks, etc. at the midpoint, along with two small tables with a few chairs. There as a somewhat cafeteria-like counter in the very back. I studiously avoided the 1st Floor Cafe &#160;until the last day I served as a juror. In a effort to conclude our deliberations that day, we agreed to a 25 minute lunch. I heard from a couple of my fellow jurors that the soup and sandwiches weren't too bad, but for reasons I can't fully explain I decided to go with cafeteria dining at its finest, and ordered the meatloaf special.Quantity-wise, no reason to complain. Probably a cup-and-a-half of canned corn. A slab of meatloaf and inch thick and so big they had to break up the last couple inches of it so it would all fit in the to-go container. A nice scoop of mashed potatoes. Everything except the corn was smothered in gravy. Quality-wise, things things are hit and miss. I can tell that mom didn't make the mashed potatoes and gravy, but it wasn't too bad. The meatloaf was interesting, in that it tasted like ketchup. A lot of ketchup The problem was that this ketchup-flavored meat slab is smothered in gravy. The gravy and the ketchup start to fight it out in my mouth for dominance over my tastebuds.

When this was brought up to our very sweet (&amp; inexperienced?) server, she came back not once but THREE times offering pretty ridiculous excuses, such as this gem: \"We\\'re using a different crab meat right now, we\\'re getting the crab meat we usually use back tomorrow!\" &#160;So I guess we got the old smelly crab meat? It was a strange way to handle a complaint, and definitely didn\\'t make anyone feel any better about anything! Also, if we can\\'t eat we might as well fill up on the coffee, right? No! Coffee refills were slow and we had to ask (multiple times!) despite her seeing empty cups. At the end, our server took two of the three barely-eaten, obviously bad dishes off the final bill (although when she originally dropped the bill, we were charged for everything - we had to ask) which was appreciated.

We loved the truffle fries and the gnocchi was fantastic as well. However, when we returned with a friend, our server was a little more on the apathetic side. We had to get up three times and she was constantly forgetting things. The food was still excellent, but I wouldn't say that about the service. I know being on Capitol Hill, it's kind of expected, but there have been other times when we have gone in there and our server was fantastic. Our last experience, was not a great one though. We sat for fifteen minutes without ever being acknowledged. Now, to be fair, there were some very large parties, but as we sat around, we noticed that there were other people who had been there for a while before us and still had not been served their drinks. We actually watched two other parties leave without ordering, which we soon did after. The bartender was a little less than helpful when my boyfriend went up and asked if they had the swordfish (which unfortunately they are always out of when we go). Now, I'm no expert on running a restaurant, but I really do think they could have more than one person serving and a bartender on staff at the same time. I am a big service person and I have found it to be disappointing more times than not. However, we have learned that if we aren't in a big rush and really don't mind waiting then it is a good choice. But, if you're hungry and are looking to be served right away, it's best to go early. We'll go back again, I'm sure, because the food is so great, but I really think there are some bugs they need to work out in the flow of running their restaurant.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"Ok - so I yelped this place before going there and I was astounded by the 4 star review after leaving totally dissatisfied.Let me first say that I come on Yelp to applaud good services as well as complain. I'm always weary of bad reviews because I feel like some people are natural complainers. This place was just BAD! Please read on..I went with a friend to have a nice brunch. It was noon and we walked into 22 Doors because it was recommended by friends. I know this place has a nightlife too, so this critique is just based on their brunch service..There were only 2 or 3 people I could identify as employees and the place was packed with tables where people were finished eating and waiting for checks. Just as we walked in some people got up and left what was to be the only free table at the time. Instead of waiting ages for someone to bus it, we sat down and patiently waited at a dirty table. The servers seemed to do that intentional avoiding-eye contact-thing so they didn't have to help us for 15 minutes or so.After ordering drinks and food I was saddened to learn that they only had one teabag of English Breakfast tea left in the whole joint. After tossing a coin my friend was the one who had to have a cup of Earl Grey instead. (muahaha). Then we ordered our food. It arrived in good time (although the people behind us arrived after we did and got their food first.)I poured my hot water into the tea mug and it wasn't hot at all. It also had some weird shredded paper in it. It looked like toilet paper but I'm assuming it was something less vile like shredded paper towel. Still gross. I actually took a sip of the tea before noticing and nearly lost my appetite before the food was served. Upon looking at the menu the prices seemed comparable to other brunch hotspots but the sides are ridiculously priced. I had the Corned Beef Hash (it was meh..) Literally though, there was a hair in it. Which I also didn't notice until I was half way through the dish. At this point I was totally over this place. My friend had the crab cake eggs benedict. I really hate when people sell food that's frozen. Why would I pay someone to heat up something I could buy at safeway for cheaper and heat up myself? I eat out to eat fresh food. So needless to say the crab cakes are pre-made and frozen and weren't very good at all.Then there was the side of sausage. The side of sausage cost $4 but it only contained 3 slices of sausage. By slices I mean, 1 whole sausage cut down the middle and then another half. So $4 for 1 and a half sausages. WTF! So each whole sausage piece is worth $2.66?? WOWZA. For that price I'd also have expected it not to be pre-frozen or available from safeway. It just feels like cheating.I think that's it .. hair in the food, bad service in general, food was just alright but sides are over-priced and the water for my tea had shreds of soggy paper in it. I'm sure this terrible service was atypical but I don't feel like giving this place a second chance to see if they deserve another star or not.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'Several friends and fellow Yelpers met up here for Kerrie and Dan\\'s going away party, and overall it was a pretty amazing time. Super sad to see them go, as their verve and overall je ne sais quoi will be sorely missed. It feels like a true light will be dimmed in the Yelp Seattle community due to their absence, and all we can hope for are frequent visits from So. Cal. But for now, the review of 22 Doors, the lucky establishment where we rocked the house.Someone really should call ahead to these places and let them know when a ton of us are descending upon them like the Greek Gods and Goddesses we are. ;) The service seemed spotty and disorganized at first, with at least the female server/bartender wearing a \"Holy Hell Get Me Outta Here, I didn\\'t sign on for this on a Sunday Night\" look. But once a few of us cleared out and the big private party in the back left, things improved considerably. So basically, I\\'m calling it 50/50 - partially our gargantuan party threw them off their game.Bartender John is exactly how I like my bartenders. Attractive, sexy, complimentary, flirtatious, and cool under pressure. His compliments didn\\'t seem fake at all or a ploy for bigger tips. That is a very critical skill to cultivate if you\\'re in the service industry - novices, please take note.Had a super long day and forgot I was on the hill, so opted for a coffee with Bailey\\'s to perk me up. Drink was exactly how I\\'d requested (about half a shot of booze), and the price really did the job: $8. Note to self: next time have tea at home and grab a pint instead. They were out of Hoegaarden so I opted for a pint of the Moose Drool. I liked the \"cozy up to the bar\" vibe perpetuated by the decor and comfortable bar stools/chairs plus hooks for your purse/jacket, etc. This review is 3 stars because I didn\\'t partake of the food, and didn\\'t want to inflate the review of the establishment based on how great a time I had with everyone. But I\\'ll definitely be back to hang out and get a better feel for the place.Street parking: Forget it. This is Cap Hill! I\\'d recommend parking a few blocks away and hoofing it, or catching a cab. There are lots of places to eat and drink along 15th and you could ostensibly make a night of it.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'I finally made it to the Emerald city, and feel the happiest girl in the world! Now drum rolls, and ready, set go! for a couple of delightful weeks of gastronomical tour with my lovely Ryan!After picking me up at the airport and running a couple of errands, we brought our growling stomachs to 22 Doors for brunch. So this review will be based exclusively on the brunch experience. We didn\\'t have to wait and sat ourselves promptly. Knowing they have a pretty impressive and popular liquor/wine/fancy drinks list, but not in the mood for something too strong, I ordered a Mimosa to pair up with my brunch. It was delicious! Made with freshly squeezed orange juice, it was tasty, fresh and perfectly bubbly. Welcome to Seattle, Valentina!I ordered the Eggs Benedict and had to go with the muffins, because the were sold out of crab cakes (Crab Cakes EB, original offer in the menu). Taking into account that we got there at 2:15 PM (brunch is Sat-Sun between 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM) I wasn\\'t that disappointed. I though \"well, maybe a little less calories\" and told our waitress to go ahead and bring me those good \\'ol muffins. Ryan ordered a burger, with the aioli in the side. Both dishes were solid. Ryan loved his burger, and told me it was perfectly cooked (medium rare). He didn\\'t like the aioli but lucky me, I used it to drown the potatoes that came with my eggs, which were pretty good. The Hollandeise sauce stood up to the rest of the ingredients, thought. It was creamy and light, yet tasty. The poached eggs were well cooked, not to &#160;hard, not to liquidy. Service was good and laid-back, a little slow but very Sunday-like. We didn\\'t have a problem with that as we were there to enjoy with no rush. We also liked the ambiance (lush, interesting decor) and loved the music they were playing, something between Wax Poetic and 70s soft, semi-erotica-esque soul...fantastic!We will definitely go back to check it out for appetizers and cocktails. Now, and after reading my fellow Seattle Yelpers\\' reviews, I can\\'t take the truffle french fries out of my mind!Update: We went back last night for a nite cap, and loved it! Spanish 43 is your drink! Oh boy, oh my, delicioso! The Shoestring Fries (truffle french fries) are ADDICTIVE. Also, nice selection in the cheese tray. We had a great time listening to post-punk Brit music. Definitely, it\\'s an nice stop for appetizers and cocktails!'},\n",

Had a dinner there once that was pretty hmmm not great -- really tough piece of meat that was just really hard to eat. Wasn't happy with that at all.Gave em a third chance. It was the only place on the block that had spots for brunch without too long of a wait (or so it seemed... *foreshadowing!*). Our first choice, of course, was Coastal Kitchen but they had a long wait and we had two couples in a rush to drive back home to Vancouver BC. Bad decision, it took a long time to get our water and our orders. Once the order was in it took more than 45 min for the food to come. No apologies, no explanation, just fucking ridiculous. We could've gone someplace with a line and still been fed sooner, which was important not just because we were in a rush, or because we expect decent service from a restaurant that competes with some of the best in the neighborhood for brunch, but because two people in our party were pregnant and need to fucking eat already. Honestly I was too pissed off to even remember afterward what the food was like. When your stomach is about to eat you from the inside out, it doesn't matter anymore.\"},\n",

The food was notoriously meh, the menu small, and the overall effect completely underwhelming.The new chef is AWESOME. I ordered grilled cheese and soup, expecting greasy comfort food, and instead got a delicate lightly crusted sandwich with an INSANELY good, nuanced and flavorful beet/carrot soup. The small plates are delish, and half price wine on Tuesdays is awesome! Also a huge fan of the bread pudding and the happy hour prawns. The wine/butter/garlic sauce = Wow.Anyway, my opinion on this place is TOTALLY changed. I'm so glad I gave it a second chance. Huge improvement. Nice work, new chef.\"},\n",

Our food orders all came at different times (there were five of us) leaving some of us frustrated with warm plates in our faces, but we kindly waited for everyone to get served before diving in.So the food. Yeah, I'm down. I enjoyed the hummus plate and crustini. Truffle fries are scrumptious, too. You get a huge plate so it's a great dish to share. The tortilla was so-so. What I enjoyed &#160;the most was the chocolate cake with TEQUILA and coffee ice cream! Sounds odd but it is a great combination. Sugar, cream, coffee, and tequila.

Found a booth right away and was served coffee only minutes after that. One thing to note is that at the time we were there, they were ONLY serving bruch. So if you are a fan of some of their standard faire (I personally dig their grilled cheese) then you may want to plan for later in the afternoon. I ordered a fried egg sandwich, with pesto and fries that really hit the spot. Not too greasy, but greasy enough to settle to stomach a bit. Fries were skinny and crisp, fresh out of the oil and delicious. My friends ordered the hash (not her favorite thing on the menu) and the french toast (which was devoured within moments of arrival). In all, a nice place to meet up, have a quick bite before a lazy Sunday afternoon!\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"Doing a quick search for pancakes on Capitol Hill brought up 22 Doors, and seeing as how it's only a few blocks away from my apartment I thought I'd give it a try. I headed over about 11AM on a Saturday and had my pick of booths to sit in. The booths are big and comfortable and could probably seat six without too much trouble. What really struck me was how light the place was, both due to windows and decor. The atmosphere was definitely laid back, though that didn't mean slow service.I ordered a relatively standard breakfast: Eggs, bacon, and toast, which I thought was a relatively good deal at $8. Other things on the menu were priced a little more unevenly, like the $2.50 drip coffee. I asked about a side order of pancakes and was informed that your $4.00 only gets you one pancake. The pancake is a pretty good size, but come on. There's got to be about a $3.98 profit margin on that.Regardless, I thought the food, the service, and the building were great. I'll be stopping by for brunch again soon.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"I have mixed feelings about 22 Doors. My first experience there was great. We went on a Sunday morning for brunch, probably while most people were sleeping off the night before. The brunch was great. I had a killer egg sandwich with french fries. Who doesn't like shoestring fries with there egg sandwich which came on sourdough with cheese and bacon. The service was great and everyone in there was very relaxed. Great vibe for an early morning. Now we went back for dinner recently and had a totally different experience. The crowd was more hipster-esque. It was louder and the people seemed to be more interested in the big screen TV on the wall than enjoying the space. It also didn't help that every time the guy behind repositioned himself in his booth, I could feel it on my side. The service was great once again, the blond girl that served us is awesome. But the food and drinks were lacking. I had the pineapple basted tempura with jasmine rice and veggies. The rice was awful, it was half cooked and while it looked pretty on the plate, it tasted horrid. The veggies were ok. I'm not big on the squash, but they were edible. The chicken was just wrong. Safeway makes a line of Asian dishes that are far more appealing than here. It had flavor I guess, but it was not worth the money. Maybe I should have tried the burger, but if you're going to charge 15 bucks for a dish, it should taste better. And while the cocktail I got was pretty, it was mediocre at best. For 10 bucks, it better taste really good, or have enough alcohol to put you out. Go for the service, go for the brunch, but avoid the chicken and overpriced cocktails.\"},\n",

The prices are fairly reasonable, they have a decent selection of wines and the food menu is interesting. The service is hit-and-miss, and it can take a while to get seated and attended to even when the joint isn't hopping. However, I've always found the brunch offerings to be solid and the portions generous. I've not tried anything on the new menu, but I've had some bites before it was revised and I remember them being quite good. Overall, 22 is a solid go-to at any point in the day, as long as you've got time and patience.\"},\n",

So, when I saw 22doors had that on their brunch menu, I had to try their version Nov 6th at 1pm.Unlike the normal shreds of corned beef mixed into mostly diced potatoes, I got huge tender chunks of corned beef on the side! A generous amount. Yay! The eggs topped the carmelized onions and sauteed spinach that were snuggled in between the corned beef and the diced potatoes.I could custom mix n match my own hash combo... and I did. The only weak spot in this dish was the horseradish cream sauce. I didn't recognize that it was supposed to taste like horseradish. (which I love)Luckily, I had a very attentive server who noticed my puzzlement and fetched a small dish of straight horseradish to make things MORE than right.They aims to please!Would I go again? Yep! Next time I'll expand my horizons with their cucumber vodka Bloody Mary.\"},\n",

Instead of cozy deep reds, three rows of wide cushy booths and art-lined walls, we walked in to find hard wood booths against the walls (leaving a gaping hole in the middle of the restaurant... dance floor we wondered?), bare walls and all the lovely character/coziness that we knew and loved... GONE. Apparently, our watering hole has a new owner? Now the menu.... luckily, the veggie burger is still on the menu (didn\\'t try it but I would assume it\\'s the same). But every other dish besides the 22 Doors burger has been replaced by eats labeled \"small\" and \"bigger\", sort of a tapas feel. Gone is the grilled cheese, incredible Caesar salad, or any dish that you don\\'t need to order at least two of to make a meal. Hate to sound like a person who fears change, but we live three blocks away and have enjoyed years of winter hot toddys with a grilled cheese sammy in a cozy/romantic atmosphere.

So wrong, but so right.22 Doors delivers up a short, but sweet (&amp; savory!) brunch menu with the right mix options from banana pancakes to crab cakes Benedict. The place is low-key and the staff is equally positioned--just the right mix of hip and genuine. In fact, the whole place is exactly that. No pretense, but enough caring to make the setting, decor, bar selection, menu, and food good w/o an overdose of irony and hipsterness. And they are nice as hell.22 Doors is my new favorite brunch spot. &#160;The one downside are the relatively thin coffee (at least this time), so come pre-caffeinated if your looking for a robust cup you can chew on. Also, I find the portions HUGE, but achievable. They just may not satisfy you if you like Wal-Mart sized behemoths of junk.'},\n",

Once we got outside, it was a very pleasant little deck thing with a few tables and wooden walls around the sides. I ordered a burger along with a cucumber cocktail. The burger was one of the best I've ever had, and I devoured every last bite- effing delicious. The drink was also amazing... I think there was basil in it- very refreshing for a summer evening. We stayed until about 9, and surprisingly it was still light out! (Being from the East Coast, I'm not used to this). Weather was perfect, food was awesome, so was the company.

I was in a water mood.we all ordered a bunch of different things, &#160;there was something different for everyone on the table, and the best part? we all shared! I got to try a lot of new things I'd never pick out for myself.the warmed olives: I'd like to preface this with the fact I HATE olives. apparantly I've been trying them wrong all this time, I looooove them warm. I am no longer an olive hater. rabbit stuffed peppers: Delicious, moist, rabbit is an interesting first for me. I will definitely be eating more rabbit in the future.fried cauliflower: oh my god, so tasty!!! this was also one of my favorites!braised ox tail: it reminded me a thick hardy but tender and scrumptious stew for some reason, I loved it though it was fantasticseafood ceviche: I've never had a ceviche before, but I was pleasantly suprised at how MUCH I loved it, it was outstanding, &#160;the citrus just kinda punches you in the face!the hangar steak: amazing, cooked to perfection, and gone in 3 seconds off of the plate. I love the small portions, plating, and the fact it forces you to socialize with friends during the entire meal. It definitely made a huge impact on me and how I enjoyed the food with my foodie friends. The waiter was phenomenal, and the food? absolutely amazing. The dishes can add up at bit but what else would you expect? This isn't a buffet. &#160;We took everything slow and we savoured it gracefully. Visiting 22 Doors was one of the highlights of my summer.\"},\n",

I think because of the combination of the dimmed lights and the two gigantic chandeliers. The two together screamed \"don\\'t you dare come in here unless you\\'re uber cool!\" (how come only cool people use the word uber, btw? =) )As I drank my beer, the place grew on me. It was quiet and relaxing. I\\'d like to go back again for drinks, though after reading the reviews, maybe I\\'ll go for waters-THAT\\'S a great date!Anywho, my hamburger was ok. The fries were great-shoestrings that were seasoned perfectly. The burger itself was also seasoned nicely, if not cooked longer than I asked for. My biggest problem, however, was that the bun was a little bit too thick for the burger. It overpowered the taste of the burger. I think 22 doors better either move to bigger burgers (and then they wouldn\\'t be fancy at all), or move to a smaller, fancy-ish style bun that\\'s not as thick as the current. Oh, last comment-cool theme.....I think there ARE really 22 doors there (some of the shelves are doors, the bar is doors, etc.)'},\n",

In general, I don't like places that are lit so dim that I can't see how my food is prepared and that members of my dinner party need to steal the LED candle on our table to find a fallen credit card, but I suppose some things must be sacrified for the ambience. To me, 22 Doors was another place on the Hill like many others that can't seem to decide what they want to be or who they want to serve. Staffed by hipsters sporting plaid shirts who had to yell at each other to be heard over the odd soundtrack of Flaming Lips interspersed with salsa and jazz, 22 Doors is sort of a mix between your neighborhood bar, coffee shop, and eatery. The clientele was equally an equally schizophrenic blend of young frat/sorority types, yuppies like us and everybody's parents. Oh, and how could I forget the odd chandeliers shaped like tasseled boobs that looked like they belonged more in a Mariott or Radisson circa 1994?I can forgive a restaurant undergoing identity crisis mode when they have good service and food, which 22 Doors has plenty of. As Dana W. mentioned, the Azul Arepa was delicious. The menu described it as shredded pork with some kind of cheese topped with caramelized figs all on a flour tortilla, and let me tell you, it was like biting into Heaven. The ravioli was decent but nothing to write home about, and while the truffle fries were good value and addictive, I thought they just tasted like regular fries, if damned good ones. I tried some of my friend's tortilla, which turned out to be the tapas dish Tortilla de Patatas, my favorite. 22 Doors's rendition was disappointing, topped with some kind of weird unmentionable sauce.I, like Dana W., was perturbed by the wall length mirror placed just so in the bathroom: once you catch a glimpse of yourself on the toilet, you just can't look away.Bottom line: good place for a group, bad place for a date (unless you don't want to hear them). Would recommend, will be back sometime.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'I had purchased a Dealpop voucher ($30 for $15) awhile back for the Pi Bakery. This morning, I thought it would be fun to head over there to have morning baked goods.My family of 4: husband, tween girl, adolescent boy, and myself enjoyed our trip. First, the parking on the street outside is \"back-in only.\" The sheriff\\'s car (with sheriff inside) was parked in a spot labeled \"sheriff\\'s parking\" across the street from 3.14. Both of those are just odd and really have nothing to do with the Pi Bakery, other than if you aren\\'t from the area, it\\'s kind of nice to know. I have never seen \"back-in only\" street parking in my life before.I thought there would be a larger selection of morning baked goods. We got there on a Sunday morning a little after 9, so it was not as though they were sold out. I had a cinnamon roll (does not come frosted, but is re-warmed in the microwave) and a drip coffee. My husband had a pecan roll, also re-heated in the microwave, and a peanut butter cookie. Tween daughter had a triple chocolate cake bite and a chocolate chip cookie with a kids hot cocoa. Adolescent son had a peanut butter and chocolate cake bite with a kids hot cocoa. (Yes, we let the kids have cake and cookies for breakfast. Probably happens less than once per year.)Everybody enjoyed their baked goods. I found my cinnamon roll filling. I rarely have rolls without frosting, but this was good and much better for the waistline as frosting doubles the number of calories. I also had a bite of daughter\\'s triple chocolate cake ball. Wow! That was very rich. The counter clerk said she can\\'t eat one of those in one sitting, but my daughter made it through, plus her hot cocoa plus her chocolate chip cookie. I had a sip of my son\\'s hot cocoa. It also was rich - lots of cocoa used.The service was very friendly. The hot cocoa took a minute to make, so she brought those to us at the table. She asked if with live in the neighborhood, to which we said no. We had a lovely chat. There was one other family (very young child) in the bakery. My son went up to ask for a glass of water because he had so much chocolate with his cocoa and PB &amp; chocolate cake ball. She was very friendly and helpful.The set-up could probably be revamped to be less restaurant-y and more cozy bakery &amp; coffee shop-y, but it isn\\'t bad. The cost value is truly good. They beat the cost at every other bakery we\\'ve been to in the greater Seattle area we\\'ve been to, including grocery store bakeries, which you might expect to cost a little less. For fresh baked goods that taste great, you can\\'t get a better deal!We\\'ll be back some day to have some pie.'},\n",

       "  'text': '3.14 Bakery is a new mom and pop bakery in the middle of the White Center business district. Adds a little more diversity into this block which has numerous pho places. The space is actually quite large. It was formerly a coffee shop and deli which explains why it looks like a restaurant.This is not one of those vegan, gluten-free or artisan baking type places. It is of the homemade tasting American variety. Bakery menu is good here with a nice selection of pastries, sweets and pies. Not many bread options, but I believe Sunday is their bread day. So go then if you are looking for some.Picked up a peach button, a slice of apple pie and bacon cheese scone along with a cup of drip Caffe Umbria coffee. The peach button was okay, though it was hard to pinpoint the peach flavors. It was nice tasting though.As pi is used in the moniker of the shop, the pie should be front and center. And it had better be good. Indeed, it was. Not top of the charts, but all around solid. Particularly the crust is of merit.Though I think the bacon cheese scone was my favorite of them all. How can you not like a pastry with bacon? It is actually reminiscent of those addictive Red Lobster cheddar biscuits, except imagine them with bacon bits on top!All in all, I think 3.14 is promising. The bakery goods are nice, though I think the space could be added upon. It seems like a space that is more suited to being a bakery/cafe serving sandwiches and soups than a pastry and coffee place. This bakery spot is new, but it certainly shows potential.'},\n",

A friend offered it as an option for coffee this morning, though, and I was all over it. Walking into 3.14 reminds me a lot of small bakeries and coffee shops in small towns. There is something very homey and down to earth about the venue with the vintage table clothes and collection of antiques on the wall and the smell of coffee and homemade baked goods. In line with other reviews, I was incredibly impressed by the friendliness of the woman working behind the counter who quickly abandoned her work on pies in the back to come and take my coffee order and grab me a pecan roll.The coffee was excellent, and the pecan roll reminded me of the ones my grandmother makes. Excellent homemade bread dough, just the right amount of cinnamon and and incredibly caramel and pecan topping. Soo good, especially with coffee and a good book. I look forward to returning and exploiting the slice of pie and coffee special. :-)I do wish that they were open later. A late night place with coffee and pie would definitely get my business.'},\n",

If you enjoy eating mounds of frosting, then you might enjoy these. The flavor isn't great, either. All in all, I would suggest you pass on the cake balls. Ended up throwing the rest away.

I got two slices one lemon meringue and one coconut cream. First of all the lemon was too tart, I think it was the recipe off the real lemon juice bottle. I don't mind tart, but the meringue should be sweeter to compensate for it. Next the coconut, which did have a good flavor, but the large pieces of stringy coconut ruined it for me. My last complaint is the crust, I believe the secret to a good pie is the crust, theirs looked and tasted undercooked. I understand with these two types of pies the bottom crust gets soggy, but the top edges should not be.I think they need to reexamine their products and step it up a bit, if you are paying over $3 for pie it needs to be better than the supermarkets.\"},\n",

A nice assortment of other baked goods, like cookies and muffins. The usual selection of coffee and espresso beverages, though I would NOT recommend getting an espresso drink here, stick to the drip coffee... (they don't know what they're doing w/ espresso pulls or Chai tea w/ steamed milk, or at least that's been my experience thus far). A lovely little play area for the toddler and preschooler set. Couches and tables/chairs for the adults. Definitely a nice option when the weather is lousy and you just need to get OUT of the house for some playtime w/ your little ones, and a sweet something for yourself. Another White Center gem!\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'This restaurant is excellent. I wouldn\\'t normally consider trying a restaurant which has three separate menus, one for each type of food they offer, but this restaurant was launched about four weeks ago by the really nice, friendly guy who recently bought out the neighboring restaurants \"Dos Amigos\" and \"Belltown Burger\". I\\'ve been a huge fan of \"Dos Amigos\" for years, so when I found out that it had been bought out, I hurried back right away only to find that the food hasn\\'t changed one bit from its original excellence.Make no mistake; this is NOT a fusion restaurant; it is one restaurant which has three separate menus; Indian, Chinese and Middle Eastern. I\\'ve ordered at least one thing from each menu, and so far this is what I have eaten:Chicken Vindaloo (extra, extra spicy):Excellent entre. It\\'s as good as the Chicken Vindaloo at the two nearby Indian restaurants, \"Tandoori Hut\" and \"Madhu\". The only noticeable difference between them is that \"Tandoori Hut\" and \"Madhu\" charge $11.95 for the chicken vindaloo and include rice with the order, but \"3 Asian\" charges $9.95 and does not include rice (but you can order a side of rice for $2). Chicken vindaloo is traditionally served extra spicy and without rice, since it\\'s meant to be eaten like a soup, and if you order and eat it this way, you will not be disappointed in the least.Vegetable Samosas:Excellent potato and pea samosas. Some of the best in town. Extremely good flavor and a nice, flaky crust.Gyro sandwich:Excellent gyro sandwich. One of the best in town. The only gyro which I have ever found in the greater Seattle area which equals or bests this gyro is located at the Pike Place Market (I forget the name of the place and don\\'t know if it\\'s even still there, but it used to be kitty-corner from the pig statue). In any case, this is really saying something.General Tsao Chicken:This was different from what I was expecting, based on what I have eaten in the past, but it turned out to be not only different but better. Whenever I\\'ve ordered General Tsao Chicken at any other Chinese restaurant, I\\'ve always received a bunch of large balls of chicken slathered with General Tsao sauce. This is what I have come to expect and even like. At \"3 Asian\", however, I received a generous portion of General Tsao Chicken mixed with vegetables and white rice. I found this to be different from what I was expecting, yet when I gave it a proper chance I found that it was actually better than what I was expecting and also better than what I have experienced in the past.I would be remiss not to mention that you can use a punch card for every order which equals or exceeds $4.50, which works at \"Bebas\\' Deli\", \"Dos Amigos\", \"Belltown Burger\" and \"3 Asian\". After three punches, you get a free fountain drink, after six punches you get a free cookie and after nine punches you get $4.50 off your next order. The guy who owns \"Dos Amigos\", \"Belltown Burger\" and \"3 Asian\" told me that he is planning to open a tapas restaurant right next door (\"3 Asian\" and the new tapas restaurant are located in the space which the Italian restaurant \"Amore\" used to occupy). The tapas restaurant should open shortly.In short, don\\'t let the fact that this restaurant serves three types of food, or the fact that it shares a space with three other restaurants which serve three different types of food, steer you away from trying this restaurant. The food is of excellent quality and priced at or below similar competing restaurants in the area.'},\n",

However, I got pretty excited by Brent's shining review and was feeling too lazy to walk to the market today so I decided to give the General Tso's a try. Can't say I would recommend it to anyone, even though I suppose you get what you pay for. In this case that was around $7 which is not really a shining deal so I suggest any hungry Belltown lunch-breakers walk a few extra blocks and plop down a few extra bucks because its worth it. Rice was not sticky at all and general resembled something from a microwave. Dish was way too salty and had no semblance of Chinese flavors to it. Honestly it felt like they just threw in a bit of the seasonings from their Indian dishes and called it a day. Blerg.\"},\n",

FOOD:A sure sign of \"meh\" food is the inability to remember what you ordered. I know I had some type of salad and fish...and that is where it stops. The salad was over dressed with a pungent vinaigrette and lacked ANY type of vegetable. Pitiful. The fish was bland and oily. My bf\\'s dishes weren\\'t any better. I have to admit it wasn\\'t all bad. Aside from the cramped quarters and a few lackluster dishes, there were some winners- specifically, the French onion soup and the pecan bread pudding were delicious.

       "  'text': 'It\\'s pretty good, but I almost gave it just 3 stars! I had brunch here with my bruncharonie friends as we often do and based on the reviews, decided to try this place for this special meal known as breakfast-lunch. Now, I had come here a few years ago on a first date with my now husband, so this place already felt warm and fuzzy to me. All three of us ordered the Croque Madame and french toast to share because it simply sounded divine. Can I just say this place has the best, fluffiest bread? It\\'s like the bread people talk about in dreams - thick, fluffy, buttery, with the perfect true brown crust. If I were a bread snob, I think I\\'d just found the perfect bread for me. Ahh....the bread. The french toast was made with aforementioned bread, buttered to perfection, with a dollop of creamy butter on top and syrup on the side. I loved the bread so much I didn\\'t even eat it with the syrup, and I think it\\'s true for almost all 4 of us! So don\\'t ask me about the syrup. I don\\'t even know what flavor it was or what color it was. It was most likely syrup colored. OK, the croque madame. I got it and it had the egg sitting on top and came with (again) aforementioned heavenly bread but as I bit into it...something felt...missing. Well, maybe not missing, but definitely \"light\". It wasn\\'t until afterward when I asked my husband why it tasted different that I realized it didn\\'t have this baked bechamel on top. If you like Cafe Presse\\'s Croque Madame like I do, you MAY be slightly disappointed, but if you like TRADITIONAL croque madame, then this is exactly what you\\'re looking for. So anyway, even though i was not excited about the Madame, I did learn that they made it the way it\\'s traditionally prepared, so I can\\'t blame them for my ignorance. It\\'s probably better for me anyway. And besides, I got the eat the bread (again) which really just about does it for me!'},\n",

Nuff said.)Hubby really liked the tarte flambe, I had a bite and thought it was nothing special. &#160;I tried his creme brulee and it wasn't too coffee-y (I am a bona-fida Seattleite who can't stand the smell, taste or look of coffee), but we were too busy laying into the beignets to bother much with it.All in all, a great meal and I would highly recommend 35SB!\"},\n",

Went there for brunch and started off with a bloody mary. This was okay, a bit on the small side size-wise and lacked any special character to set it apart. Pretty run of the mill, I'd say. Had the macaroni and cheese appetizer which was great -- perfectly and delectably cheesy. My one request would be more salt, but that's just me. One of my friends had the chicken pot pie -- you just don't see such a perfectly flaky crust. The dish was a hit. My other friend had the eggs benedict which looked fantastic. I had the mussels and fries which were fantastic. The mussels were perfectly cooked and extra large. The broth was nice but I'd suggest they serve a few pieces of bread as part of the dish to soak up the broth. Nonetheless, bread can always be ordered as an extra. The fries weren't skinny, but were nicely crisped and doubled fried, and were served with a lovely aioli. Lastly, we had the bourbon pecan bread pudding. They had me at bourbon. This was lick-the-plate good. Their portions are very generous, their wine selection is good, and their menu has so many yummy selections. I would definitely eat here again. It's a classy but comfortable interior and the service is excellent.\"},\n",

I had the fish of the day, which was seared salmon. It was sensational. My lovely date had the prawn risotto. She too found her pick to be more than worth whole. The two of us shared a small pale of the Bistro's famed frites. These are fries, but fancy, sexy, and refined fries. Peppered with Parmesan cheese, the hints of garlic and salt...oh my, it was quite the experience. At only 5 bucks a pale, this is a great deal. Fantastic for dates, great for small groups, and over all a really nice place to have food and drinks. I recommend trying the Negroni. Part gin, part vermouth, part bitter...all amazing.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"This is one of my favorite brunch destinations in the Seattle area.When I first come here, I order a drink right away. Their mimosas are always yummy, but if I'm looking to mix it up, I'll just switch to a Bloody Mary. The drinks are always top notch, and I love that the garnish is overflowing in the Bloody Mary. Just how I like it!The drinks are the perfect accent to the complementary mini muffins which are brought to the table. These take complimentary bread to the next level, offering a huge variety of goodies to munch on. Once, they were pumpkin muffins with sunflower seeds; another time, delicious chocolate chip muffins. Really, I could munch on these and sip cocktails all day, but then I'd be missing out on some amazing entrees!!Their brioche french toast ranks among the best french toast I've had. With a bit of syrup it's perfect. But what if you're craving brioche, but don't want the sweet option for brunch? Well, then let me direct you to the Croque Madame!! A delicious ham sandwich with their brioche bread topped with a fried egg. Paired with a nice side salad, it makes the perfect brunch entree.Now, let me say that there are some entrees that have left me a little disappointed. For example, the Eggs in the Basket entree gets you (for the same cost as the Croque Madame) only *one* piece of brioche, eggs, a mushroom / bacon sauce, and no side salad. I can understand how that entree would be a bit of a let down. So my advice - don't stray from the stars of the menu!! French toast, Croque Madame, and a nice brunchy drink, and you'll be just fine. If you're worried about ordering two entrees, then fear not - the french toast also comes as an appetizer. :)\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"Delicious brunch!!! Went on a sunny Sunday for brunch. We were seated under the tree. It was a cute restaurant that reminded me of France. I had Eggs Benedict with prosciutto. It came with a light and fresh side salad and nicely seasoned potato. The prosciutto were a bit salty, and there was a lot of it. I had some of them with my salad and potato, and it was good. My friend had the mussels that were steamed with white wine, garlic, and chili flake and served with skinny fries. Very fresh and mouth watering mussels. Yum yum. I like the fact that they use fresh and local ingredients that are sustainable. Every restaurant should do that! &#160; Our waiters were warm and attentive, though they forgot the lemon wedges we asked for three separate times. For that I should probably give them 4 stars. But the food was really good on a nice Sunday afternoon, and it was a good dining experience after all. So I'm giving it 5 stars instead.I would totally go back all the time if I lived closer to Fremont.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"Dined with the family here last night for the annual Dine Out For Life Aids charity event. Greeted warmly and promptly seated. I thoroughly loved that each table has its own bottle of water, yes very European but not in a poshy-snobby way at all. Practical for us.Ian and the child each had the Bistro burger. Ian had bleu cheese and the child went with the cheddar. She ate half, which is her routine dinner plan so she can save room for dessert. The other half never made it out of my purse until this morning and is now in my bedroom. My bedroom stays pretty chilly so I'm hoping for a cheddar-burger snack when I get home ... No, not really. :o)Mom and I both got the steak frites: steak medium rare (perfectly so) and the right portion of frites. The bleu cheese cream that accompanied the steak was so light and fluffy I confess I ate it straight out of the ramikin. I did smooth some over my steak and allow for the dainty haricot verts to play in it too. But seriously it tasted divine right off the tip of my fork.Dessert was a selection of blueberry muffin-cake-bisquit thingee in a lemon sabayon sauce, butterscotch pots de creme (a sublimely creamy and decadent yet unoffensive butterscotch creme brulee-like w/o the burnt sugar custard), and trois chocolate (a wee scoop of white chocolate espresso sorbet on a wafer-thin crisp, chocolate panna cota, and a chocolate cake with pistachios) for the resident chocolate whore at my house, Ian. :o)Flawless and severely unpretentious service (I was surprised, yes I'll admit it). The child enjoyed the openness of the dining area and the wee bathroom because it was welcoming to her, so children friendly this place may be but I'd venture only for well behaved children.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"We were here for brunch (reservations made through OpenTable for points) and ordered two egg benedicts with their housemade sausage, an 'eggs in the basket' (which was recommended with extreme certainty from the waiter), and coffee/tea.The eggs in the benedict dishes were just barely even cooked. The whites were that gooey opaque color that grosses me out but I was game and kept eating. Not enough hollandaise sauce, I can't even remember the taste of it, there was so little. The side salad and potatoes were nice though.The eggs in the basket, on the other hand....verrrrry underwhelming. The serving was tiny, one slice of toast (barely thicker than the sliced sandwich bread you buy in the grocery stores). The egg was cooked in the cut-out center of the bread and then the sauce. The taste was right, but Cafe Campagne did it SO MUCH better and it came with frites! But not here, no side salad or potatoes. Just a sad piece of tiny soggy toast.No one came by after our food was given to us to ask how the food was. Perhaps they could tell my hub was NOT pleased with his eggs in a basket dish. I wonder why it was recommended so strongly when it sucked. I wish my eggs were actually cooked and probably would have admitted they were nearly raw had someone come to ask how everything is.Somehow this meal was over $20pp (with tip). Not coming back here ever again.Edited September 2010: owner contacted me in a very nice manner for that I'll add one more star.\"},\n",

Also the bread basket had the best bread. There was this thinly sliced raisin bread that was to die for! Thin like paper, crispy and sweet. I really liked it. The pizza was really different. I have no idea what was on it but it was like there was a huge party in my mouth. So many diferent flavors at once! For the entree my mom and I split the mussles. WOW. They were HUGE. Fresh. Clean. Amaazing! We were so full by the time we ate those, but it being my mom birthday we ordered the beignets and the bread pudding. Seriously. Try the bread pudding.

Not too sweet and not too much dressing. &#160;I only wish the goat cheese had been soft, rather than the shaved goat cheese. &#160;Great sized salad to share before a meal. &#160;Very generous portion and great value for the $8. &#160;We also split the salmon special entree. &#160;Israeli cous cous was amazing with bacon and wilted frisee. &#160;The special was $28 and the piece of salmon was less than 3 oz (and that's being generous). &#160;It was &#160;a fantastic dish but just would have like to see a slightly larger piece of fish for that price. ** Fish was perfectly cooked though.We also split the Tarte Flamb&#233;e which was a french style pizza. It was described as having caramelized onions, bacon and gruyere. &#160;When it came out it was almost completely white. &#160;The onions were cooked but not anywhere near caramelized. I was expecting a darker color and more flavor. &#160;It also seemed like it might have been sitting in the back for a bit as the cheese had started to set up a bit. &#160;Not bad but wouldn't order it again.Saving the best for last......DESSERT! We split the Tarte au Fromage Blanc (vanilla cheese cake with lavender short bread, blackberry jam and lemon curd) and the Pain Perdu Aux Noix de P&#233;can (bread pudding made from brioche). &#160;I agree with the previous reviewer that was almost embarrassed with how much we loved the desserts. I can honestly say these are two of the best desserts I have ever eaten in my entire life (and I try a new restaurant almost every week.)This is one of my new favorite restaurants! &#160; My only other suggestion would be to have the servers/hostess have a bit more enthusiasm. &#160;Our server was the owner and she was great but some of the other people working at the restaurant seemed like they didn't really want to be there and didn't really smile/engage in conversation.\"},\n",

When we looked inside the basket, we found 2 scones, as described by our server, but they were approximately an inch square. The bread basket seemed ginarmous in comparison to the scones.

Service was quick, and given the off hour (3pm) it was pretty quiet.The wine list was extensive, and my dining companion noticed the owner sitting nearby working on a new menu, so he asked for a recommendation for a Spanish red. Sadly, they were out of it, but he came back with an even better bottle - 2005 Pesquera Ribera del Duero Tinto. It was excellent and the perfect complement for our meals.We started with a bistro salad (delicious, with the exact right amount of dressing), followed by moules et frites (mussels + fries - the small portion is plenty large) and duck confit (which practically fell off the bone).I am very much looking forward to returning here soon.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'A birthday dinner celebration with another couple brought us back to the 35th Street Bistro with memories of great dinners in the past. &#160;By the time we were leaving, we had all agreed it was one of the best dining experiences we had had in our wide range of Seattle dining options.First, the setting. &#160;It\\'s always so cozy in here. &#160;We had a table against the front windows, the ficus is remarkably thriving, and the lighting nice and flattering. &#160;Next, the service. &#160;Our server was remarkably nice and knowledgeable about the menu. &#160;She made two recommendations for entrees, and both of them were delicious (the aged steak and the sausages with lentil). &#160;She was attentive without being overbearing. &#160;And did I mention nice? &#160;And then the topper: &#160;after we were done with our entrees, a fellow in a white coat and hat came out to chat with us about our meal (and to tease me about the sausage left over on my plate....that\\'s lunch for tomorrow!). &#160;All signs pointed to him being the chef, and once he heard that there was a birthday to celebrate, he volunteered a complimentary dessert for the occasion. &#160;Mmmmm, a delicious slice of bundt cake with ice cream soon followed. &#160;Our server referred to him as \"the owner\", and if that\\'s the case then I appreciate his table-side visit even more. &#160;We all raved about our experience for the rest of the evening, and even now we bring it up and talk through the whole thing all over again...'},\n",

       "  'text': 'I\\'ll have to try this place again, but my first meal here was a bit more toward \"average\" than I was hoping for / expecting. The service was excellent (except for the bit about the guy behind me sitting too far from the table and the servers repeatedly bumping my chair, until I moved far enough back, myself, that they had to squeeze through). The food...well, the food was not up to its price. My sweetie and I split an order of sea scallops on a succotash of corn and melted leeks, with some salted pea shoots on the side. The succotash and the shoots were nice, but the scallops weren\\'t as fresh as I\\'d expected. They didn\\'t wad up in my mouth or anything, but they sure as heck didn\\'t melt, and for $14 for 3 scallops, I\\'m not expecting as much resistance as I got.For the main course I had the lemon and ricotta ravioli in a cream sauce, with toasted almonds, if I\\'m remembering right. It was nice, but in reality (i.e. the place where my tastes rule and nothing else matters...) it would have been much better served by a light butter or beurre blanc sauce: the cream sauce was just too heavy and overwhelmed the delicate lemon and ricotta. Though I will say it was pretty tasty when soaked up with bread.My sweetie had \"tuna two ways\": seared ahi and a tuna tartare. The ahi looked right, but wasn\\'t as flavorful as I\\'m used to, and the tartare was bland (in contrast to what I got at chez shea lounge).The wine list is good and varied, and they make an excellent cucumber martini, and I enjoyed the atmosphere (though the inside is a bit loud). Now that I\\'ll be in the hood more, I\\'ll be back, but not before trying a bunch of other places.Update: went back with a group from work and the service was really slow, the cheese was nice, but the stuffed sole was overly salty.'},\n",

       "  'text': \"French fries. Frites. Patatas. While too often associated with bad health and lowly fast food joints with questionable sanitation, french fries are, to me, a subject of intense scrutiny and much field research. It's a food that requires the utmost respect. From paper cones in Amsterdam to the salt and vinegar fry stands on &#160;the New Jersey boardwalk to the olive-oil soaked wedges served with dollops of tomato puree and mayo at tapas joints in Spain: fried potatoes are staples from the old world, deep-fried delicacies that, when eaten, say, once a week and in moderation, can be part of a healthy person's diet. At least, in my head they can. The key thing is matching the right fry with the right food. Mussels in white wine, for instance, require the truly French french fry. That is: skinny, unskinned, cooked in a light oil and sprinkled with sea salt. These same fries would be ridiculous with a hamburger or served on a small plate at tapas, but when dipped in mussel-flavored, herb-laden white wine broth, they are utterly perfect. Which is why, when I go to the 35th Street Bistro, I can't seem to order anything besides the moules/frites. These people really know their fries. Mixed with the simple, delicious fare is a understated decoration scheme: warm light, neutral paint, dark wood, that gives this place a sort of updated old world bistro feel - at once modern and classic- making it a great place to take out of towners, dates, or anyone else who can appreciate a good fry.\"},\n",

       "  'text': \"during our short trip to seattle, i completely fell in love with the city. i never thought i'd say this, but i could move to this rainy, windy, cold city. i know i probably have to rely heavily on caffeine to uplift my mood, but there's no shortage of coffee in seattle and i do love sugar loaded latte. fremont, a small, quaint town about 10-15 minutes away from downtown seattle, specifically could be my new home. friends took us here to show another side of their beloved town of residence, and now i understood why they didn't hesitate choosing seattle as their favorite place (they lived in miami, chicago and austin, among other places). we ended up having dinner at 35th street bistro before doing a bit of touristy things. the restaurant offered 3 course prix fixe at $30 that night, and we all settled for that deal. my first course was local mussels in white wine and garlic reduction. the mussels were tiny but very fresh and tender. the husband's butternut squash soup could've been better with a hint of sweetness. for my main course, i chose steak au poivre. i absolutely loved this dish. the aged sirloin was tender and flavorful, even better than some filet mignon i paid for over $50. it was accompanied with spring salad with light vinaigrette, and the balance between bitterness from the greens and acidity from the dressing was perfect. i had a few pieces of husband's pan fried tiger prawns and diver scallops and also thought it was a great entree dish. the shrimp, a tad bit over cooked and salty, were big, but the scallops were far better. i loved nibbling on pomme frites that came with the husband's entreee, albeit i had better ones. the desserts were a little disappointment though. the pecan bread pudding with a scoop of vanilla ice cream was too sweet and the fruit crisp (apple slices, i can't quite remember), also with vanilla ice cream, was overly sour. we received excellent service from our waitress. she was very patient while we were perusing the menu and selecting wine, and pleasantly followed up with our requests. i loved the restaurant decor and ambiance. like any french bistro, the tables were in close proximity, but it didn't feel crowded and the place felt very inviting and casual yet romantic. it was a great way to end our seattle trip. i am so glad that we ventured out a little to discover this charming town...maybe, someday, a place i can call home :)\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'This will be the first time I specifically yelped about something because it was bad. &#160;I went to the 35th St Bistro with out of town friends during the 30/30 Dine Around Seattle. I specifically cancelled our reservations at Brasa and opted for 35th St. because I thought it would be more accessible and the menu online looked yummier.The first part of my experience was our own fault; due to rain and traffic my guests were late for our reservations. I was terribly apologetic and, when told they were booked, asked that they do what they can. The hostess was about as friendly as a doormat and was uninterested in helping us resolve our issue her manager however was helpful and said if we didn\\'t mind waiting he\\'d get us seated. &#160;Luckily or Sadly it was not just us to whom she was rude. Her overall attitude when people walked in off the street was disdain and she just seemed miffed that people would dare come by for drinks.Well, getting to the food. It was overall VERY unremarkable. The appetizers we tried at our table were the Parsnip soup (bland), a mixed green salad (boring) and escargot (sandy, but hey, we tried snails). Entrees at our table we especially pathetic, the spare ribs while tender, were pretty flavorless and the \"potato puree\" was flat and bland. Dessert was good but not remarkable. We had the bread pudding which was tasty but unimaginative and profiteroles which were good but tasted remarkably like the cream puffs at Safeway.Service was pretty bad too. Our waitress was not to be found for most of the meal and glasses stood empty almost the whole time. I guess we were written off right away (maybe our punishment for being late) and forgotten about but the check was plunked down before the last of our forks had been set down (a personal pet peeve at nice restaurants).It was a pretty bad experience and I am a bit disappointed, 30bucks may be cheap for some but it was a splurge for us and wish the experience (or at least the food) had been better.

The prices are fair and the food is always visually appealing, appropriately portioned, served hot, and very yummy. My favorite thing about this place is the vibe. The music is at perfect volume (today they had on Cold Play, The Shins, Sia, Band of Horses... all on my faves list) and the light is beautiful (so was my boyish blue eyed server.)This place is great for lunch and super great for cocktails.

The sole was laid on lettuce, olives and a couple potatoes in a lovey dressing. The berry tart had lots of blueberries. I would walk barefoot in the snow for the food.However, the space is small and cramped and the noise level unbearable. We went there on a Tuesday at 7PM and the place was almost full. they seated us and put a bottle of tap water on the table (no cute pushing of spring water). After putting in the order we waited for the bread, we waited a long time for the salads and even longer for the entrees. Although servers walked by all the time, requests for more water and bread went unfulfilled. Our waitperson, Amanda, seemed distracted and forgetful. To the management's credit they apologized for the delays (blaming it on a large party overwhelming the kitchen and staff) and deducted the price of the most expensive item (the steak) from the check. A real class act.To sum: Food to die for, marred by service glitches and extremely noisy space.\"},\n",

It\\'s a really cute place, the people were very nice, and the food was really quite good. &#160;We started with a salad and a TON of bread (they were generous with the refills!). &#160;My entree was the tarragon chicken which included greens and farro. &#160;I\\'m pretty picky about my chicken but I enjoyed it. &#160;My boyfriend (are we all sick of hearing about him yet?

Graham wasn\\'t as much of a fan because it was \"too sweet\" (not possible!) but I was pretty excited about it.Overall, not a bad little place. Good atmosphere. &#160;I laughed because the girls next to me were obviously recruiters bitching about work... and I am a recruiter who is often found bitching about work... so I felt a little less alone in the world. :) &#160;I think their menu just needs a little more variety to it (I see they used to have soups.. not any longer) and they\\'d be all set. &#160;I look forward to trying them out again and sitting outside once it finally gets a little warmer out there. :)'},\n",

       "  'text': \"After a month inside with baby on maternity leave I was itching to get out for a romantic dinner with my hubby, and I was so happy to have picked this place. The ambiance is fantastic. It brought back many fond memories of my trips to the Mediterranean coast, having late night dinners at the various bistros in the coastal cities of Italy and France. The white christmas lights, coffeehouse music, and mellow mood lighting was perfect for sipping a glass of wine and having good conversation without it being too loud. Now onto the food - I'm not too fond of French food and its typical duck, rabbit, and liver mousse options but 35th bistro isn't the typical French bistro. The menu had a variety of options that I think anyone would love. &#160;We decided to have the 3 course dinner for $30 and added the wine flight option for $25 that paired each dish with a different type of wine. We loved the French pizza, cream of mushroom soup, steak with pomme frites and the pecan bread pudding!The reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the price is a little high for the type of wines you get, but I did take a peak at their happy hour menu, and it's a really great deal. This is definitely a place I will be going back to over and over again.\"},\n",

Finally, I made it!My friend and I went for happy hour which is convenient because it goes until 6:30 instead of the standard 6 which always creates a bit of a rush. As soon as we stepped though the door, we were instantly transported to a little bar in France. The interior was so cute with wallpaper and a small, intimate bar. Good lighting in the dining area with the open windows. Would be a great place to take a date.The two of us shared the eggplant salad (non-happy hour item, $8) which was light and flavorful with the arugula, tomatoes, and roasted eggplant. I am usually not an eggplant eater but it worked really well with this salad.We split the Reuben sandwich which my friend didn\\'t care for much but I thought was delicious. A good balance of the corned beef and sauerkraut with just enough thousand island dressing. I am not a typical Reuben-lover because the flavors are often too overpowering for me but this one hit the spot! The sandwich was $5. Not a huge sandwich but big enough to split if you get something else to go along with it. The bistro fries were just okay I thought, though the big portion with brioche on the side was generous.For a drink I had the 35th &#160;Street Martini which was described on the menu as being served \"with seasonal fruit\". The fruit this time was strawberry and it was delicious! The strawberry was pureed but the martini was still smooth with no weird chunks or strings of fruit in it. For $5, this was a great deal as well.Overall, happy with the experience. The eggplant salad was my favorite out of what we sampled. The happy hour selection is a little limited but there are enough choices to snack on. Next time I\\'ll have to splurge on dinner!'},\n",

       "  'text': 'cute little place that, for once, actually looks like a bistro...we decided to share the \"cheese collage\". &#160;the name sounded kinda goofy but it kinda was a work of art. &#160;definitely too big for 2 people, 5 cheeses were laid out on a large cutting board adorned with a splash of olive oil, a truly aged balasmic vinegar, candied walnuts, marcona almonds drizzled with honey, a spray of thinly sliced apples poking out of a mound of fresh fig paste, a chunk of dark chocolate &amp; plenty of thinly sliced sheaves of macrina french bread. &#160;as for the cheese; &#160;there was a stilton, 2 cows\\'milk &amp; 2 goats\\' milk cheeses. &#160;unusually, the drunken goat cheese was deemed the table favorite. &#160;overall, the cheeses were well thought out if not exceptionally exotic but, given the presentation &amp; accoutrement, this put other cheese plates to shame. for my starter, i had grilled asparagus w/proscuitto, endive &amp; parmesan shavings. &#160;i could\\'ve done with more parmesan but i think that\\'s more a personal choice rather than a difficiency. &#160;the asparagus was very grilled indeed but it was the prosciutto that really stood out; &#160;thicker &amp; fresher than average &amp; generously piled on, this side dish was much heartier than one could\\'ve guessed.for my entree, i ordered the muscovy duck breast over leek ragout w/a wild rice flan. &#160;there was also some sort of sweet onion jus going on. &#160;it was a complicated dish, let me tell you. &#160;while there didn\\'t seem to be a lot of duck there, it was prefectly medium rare (&amp; i still didn\\'t finish it all) &amp; very juicy &amp; savory. &#160;i found the leek ragout a little too lemony &amp; the wild rice flan was a strange but not unsuccessful presentation. &#160;the little onion thingies though, man, those were great. &#160;in fact, i think they might have been what tied the whole thing together. &#160;overall, an overly tszujed dish that still gets by on flavor.dessert: &#160;alemon-sour cream tartelette that was almost as big a half a damn pie. &#160;not that we didn\\'t eat it all. &#160;seriously. &#160;the deep crust was thin &amp; flakey, the inner lemon custard was tart &amp; fresh tasting, topped by a cloud of meringue-like whipped cream. &#160;i would definitely order that again. incidentally, aside from a small lapse in water, our server was excellent. &#160;friendly, knowledgeble about the food &amp; willing to offer an opinion whenever we were torn between two dishes.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Every few years one finds a restaurant that gets it right, or close enough to right that only a curmudgeon could complain.Visiting Seattle, we stumbled upon the 35th Street Bistro in the early afternoon and found it near perfect. Entering, we found a space that felt just right--clean, uncluttered, well organized, with (always a good sign) the French \\'varietal maps\\' framed on the wall. The entire place was spotlessly clean and well presented.The menus (the happy-hour and lunch menus were both offered to us) contained many delightful small dishes--I had the croque monsieur and BLT sliders, but was somewhat surprised that they were served cold, or cool, but they were excellent and, at $3 each, exceptional value. The butter-lettuce/roquerfort salad was right on the money, as was the French onion soup, 100% authentic. One of our guests had the moules marinieres, and the generous serving of large, succulent clams came in a spicy broth that managed to be light and piquant at the same time, ideal for dunking the bread they served, when the clams ran out. The French chardonnay went down well, a contrast to some of the over-oaky, over-alcoholed California equivalents. Again, the wines offered were great value and the French leaning was appropriate for the restaurant.We ordered a double serving of frites for the group. They came with a perfect aioli sauce. From the light color, it was clear that they had been prepared in fresh oil (when they come out dark, it means--as most people know--that the oil is getting old).We all shared the beignets for desert, served with two sauces, caramel and chocolate, and they were as good as any I\\'ve ever eaten, including some of the \\'world famous\\' servings in New Orleans. The service was exceptional, prompt and professional, and I had the chance to speak with the proprietor, a charming young woman, who took time out of her busy day to talk about her place.I want to go back to try the entire menu but basically our party of six was entirely satisfied and felt the same way. We\\'re visitors to Seattle but they live there and they\\'ll be back, guaranteed. If we lived there we\\'d be regulars until we achieved the status of what Alfred Hitchock said, when answering the question about what was the best restaurant in town. He responded: \"The one where they know you.\"Visiting or living locally, you have a gem of a place to visit.'},\n",

The new cheese plate is great because you can order individual cheeses instead of having to order a whole plate. The wine list was very reasonably priced (lots around $30). Last time, we ordered a bottle of Guggenheim Malbec (our server's suggestion) and it went perfectly with our meal.

       "  'text': 'For several years, I walked past 35th Street Bistro, and always said, \"One of these days...\" Well, one night, en route to yet another Thai meal, my boyfriend and I decided it was High Time. Pricewise, we\\'d already upgraded to Tawon Thai over Mad Pizza, as it would be a warmer meal, so what was another $30 for a fancier place? In this case, it turned out to be more like $50 more than Tawon, when all was said and done.The 35th Street Bistro is hands-down, the most expensive establishment in Fremont. It is also one of the nicest. The cost is somewhat justified.We started with the Bistro Salad, described as: \"frisee, radicchio and iceburg lettuce, tomatoes, pancetta and creamy blue cheese dressing -- with fried onion strings and hard-boiled egg.\" The pancetta was really bacon, and the iceburg wedge was the most notable part of this salad, architecturally-speaking. Accompanying this, we started our dinner with the house bread with their onion relish (bueno!!) and tapenade, along with a glass of Chianti for him, and Pinot Gris for me. Both were adequate enough.For our main course, he had the Osso Bucco and I had the Seared Ahi Tuna. The Osso Bucco came with a tasty, buttery polenta and the dish was hearty and perfect for the cold evening. I had the fennel-encrusted seared ahi tuna and I loved it. My dish was served with greens and chanterelle mushrooms, in a tomato-based sauce. The spiciness was just about perfect--not overpowering, and just hot enough.Bonus points awarded for the later-night service. They were open until 11 PM on a Sunday night, most likely in competition with late-night service at Jai Thai and Chiso, both within a block\\'s radius. Before the tip, our bill came to $73 for the two entrees, the salad, and wine (the wine portion was under $25). I can\\'t say I\\'d pick this place for a special occasion, and it\\'s too expensive for a weekly outing. The service was great, so it pains me that I can\\'t recommend it without reservations. For all the positive press I\\'d read, I couldn\\'t help but feel that this place is way over-hyped, so I was disappointed.'},\n",

I had the beet salad which was good, but I may have had overly high expectations from the prior reviews. My bf had the tuna carpaccio which was flavorful but the olives completely overpowered the tuna. I HIGHLY recommend the Muscovy Duck and steak frites... they really know how to do the classics. My duck was so tender and had a wonderful sauce, the steak was very juicy. We had the profiterols which was average actually... i probably wouldnt order it again. Service was nice. Dinner for 2 was $92 before tip. 2 apps, 2 entrees, 1 dessert and 2 drinks. Very reasonable prices. Overall, i would definitely come back, great restaurant! &#160; (Note review from 01/08)'},\n",

Looking on the Citysearch site earlier today while bored at work, I didn\\'t have high hopes for a good experience. While foodies had great reviews, the service was panned and the food described as uninspired. My vegan fussiness and hatred for pretentious restaurants almost guaranteed a nasty night. Praise Jesus and his holy name, I was wrong.Everything was just fine. Not fine like fine dining, necessarily, but fine, like, when you ask someone you saw 20 minutes ago how he\\'s doing and he says: \"Fine.\" We sat right down, the staff was smiley, and when I asked what they had for veggies, our waitress said that they had blah blah blah, or \"You could just trust the chef.\" I did, and it was fine. I got me a plate of braised exotic, likely organic, fancy veggies. Weird little carrots, funny long onions with bulbs at the bottom, yellow grape tomatoes, regular asparagus, regular roma tomatoes, and three crimini mushrooms. No problems, everything was fine and dandy.My tables\\' meals all seemed yummy. The mussels-n-fries is good enough for two. And, it looks like the fries are good for two as well, unless you\\'re both pigs. Around the horn, we got the full battery of salads and they all looked good. The risotto seemed small, but, with all the mussels that dude ate... Somebody got the halibut and it looked flaky, which means it was probably good.The staff was slow, but the ambience of the place dictates its pace. This is a restaurant where you spend a long time with friends you haven\\'t seen in a while. It\\'s not fast food, and it seems impossible for them to accommodate a quick meal. Knowing what I know between the aforementioned foodies and the grumps, I\\'d actually go on record to say that it\\'s a low-rent nice restaurant. For all its faults, it seems like they treat people OK and those with $75 to blow on dinner have fun if they don\\'t expect to be home early.Bottom line: Give it a try on a slow night. Get there early if you\\'re in a hurry. Don\\'t complain, there\\'s plenty of warning out there that seating isn\\'t their strong suit. Trust the chef, you\\'ll be fine.'},\n",

Last time I came here for lunch I got the Moules Marinere which were extremely fresh and cooked to perfection. I'm not kidding when I say they were some of the best mussels I've had in my life!!! Note: They even beat out Thomas Kellers mussels over at Bouchon in Napa Valley. I've always had an enjoyable experience at 35th Bistro and would recommend this place to anyone whose in the mood for french bistro food in the afternoon.\"},\n",

Decided to try out this place for a double date with new friends. &#160;Made a Friday night 6:30 reservation. &#160;We were seated promptly with water glasses on the table but no menus. &#160;The server disappeared. &#160;It wasn\\'t until she returned nearly ten minutes later and I asked for a wine list that she realized. &#160;I ordered a hot toddy; my boyfriend ordered a French \"35\" cocktail (Gin, Prosecco, fresh muddled lemon, St. Germain Liquere). &#160;Several minutes later, mine comes out and the server says the other is on the way; she had to bring mine out now because \"it was getting cold.\" &#160;She was right - it was lukewarm. &#160;That\\'s okay for some people, but I ordered a \"hot\" toddy, not a \"lukewarm\" toddy. &#160;Disappointment. &#160;The French \"35,\" however, was excellent - nice balance of citrus and gin. &#160; Thirty-five minutes after we placed our appetizer/entree order, the appetizers arrived. &#160;By this time I was regretting not ordering an appetizer - I initially wasn\\'t overly hungry so I passed but I hadn\\'t factored in the extended wait time. &#160;I checked my watch... 8:06. &#160;When the entrees finally arrived, it was 8:15 and the elapsed time between placing the order and receiving it was at least SEVENTY-FIVE MINUTES. &#160;In Seattle?!?! &#160;With the restaurant EMPTY when we arrived and later filling up throughout the night?! &#160;There were no apologies for the unacceptable wait time (unacceptable by both customer AND restaurant standards), no offers for a free drink or appetizer to compensate, and no communication about when it was going to arrive (except for a few minutes prior).We tried the trout, steak frites, New York steak and the grilled pork chop. &#160;My steak came closer to medium than medium rare but by that time I was too hungry to complain. &#160;Everything else, however, got favorable reviews. &#160;We ended the meal with the house made brioche donuts, served with dark chocolate and salted caramel sauces. &#160;Mouthwatering and highly recommended. &#160; &#160; Maybe I\\'d try this place for happy hour because it\\'s close to where I live, but the dinner service was unacceptably slow. &#160;Either an apology for the wait time or an offer for a free drink/appetizer, or - ideally - both, could have remedied this.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'We moved to Fremont several months ago and are slowly learning the various cool eateries that surround us. &#160;We\\'d walked past the Bistro plenty while doing other errands and finally decided to check it out Thursday night, for my birthday. &#160;We did not have reservations but had no problem being seated in short order. &#160;The 35th Street Bistro currently is our top neighborhood pick for its wonderful balance of three key things: comfortable atmosphere, engaging staff, and interesting, well-prepared food.The restaurant itself feels a bit as though it came from another era--a rustic atmosphere thanks largely to its location in an old (19th century or early 20th century) storefront that reminded me of ancient seaside resorts or that tucked-away French bistro in an actual French town that everyone but the tourists knows about. &#160;Our server was amiable and knowledgeable, describing the evening\\'s specials and happily answering our questions. &#160;We never felt rushed or confused by the service, which may seem a small matter, but at some restaurants an entire evening may be ruined by poor service. &#160;We had some questions about wine parings and regional fruit and enjoyed talking with our server. &#160;I wish I had got her name, but it seems to be common at most restaurants anymore for staff to no longer introduce themselves by name. &#160;One question I wish we had asked: the halibut special as written on their menu board mentioned an ingredient called \"quiroin,\" something with which I had no familiarity. &#160;We speculated that it might have actually been \"quinoa.\" &#160;More on that in a sec.We shared the calamari appetizer, lightly grilled and buttery, beautifully &amp; simply plated. &#160;My partner had the French onion soup, fairly standard. &#160;I had the watermelon-mint soup, a refreshing cold soup that balanced flavors very well but set my mind to imagining ways to give it some spark--perhaps some spice as a base note, even. &#160;For entrees, my partner had the trout served with pomme frites, which he said was very well-prepared. &#160;I selected the halibut, which was, indeed, served on a bed of quinoa with greens in a light broth. &#160;It was maybe the best halibut dish I\\'ve ever had, cooked perfectly with wonderfully complimentary flavors from the browned quinoa and crunchy greens. &#160;I\\'d come again just for this entree alone, but I\\'m eager to try their other offerings. &#160;We each had white wine, a sauvignon blanc and a charodnnay (by-the-glass selections, of which there is a nice, somewhat short list. &#160;There is also an impressive list of bottles on offer, in a variety of price ranges), both well-suited for our dishes. &#160;For dessert, I had the fruit crisp--a selection of apple, rhubarb, and blackberries with a crisp topping and a dollop of buttery ice cream served in a ramekin. &#160;The taste was wonderful even if I must admit I was unable to detect the rhubarb from the apple as the fruit had been steeped together in some fashion such that it was all a burgundy color. &#160;But: delicious. &#160;My partner had the \"peaches Napoleon\" and gave it a hearty thumbs-up. &#160;We each enjoyed a glass of port with dessert, a 1997 and a 2005 (I *think.* &#160;I\\'m going from memory here; I know one was Portuguese), both very good, full-bodied after dinner drinks, one more woody while the other was more fruity-acidic. &#160;In all, it was a really great outing. &#160;The sole thing I wish I could have changed, which was no fault of the restaurant, was that there was a guy in a party of four seated next to us at the front of the place who was a non-stop loud crushing boor whose every other word was a profanity. &#160;At first, we were annoyed. &#160;Then, we felt sorry for his interlocutors, some of whom at least appeared embarrassed. &#160;Finally, we just decided to focus on our desserts and how much we liked the port! &#160;We look forward to successive visits and to our first chance at bringing relatives with us.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Our waiter and bartender, Joseph, made our first visit to 35th St. Bistro memorable and enjoyable. We didn\\'t have a full meal there but moseyed in to try out their happy hour. It looked a bit fancy at first, but we ended up feeling totally comfortable (despite my boyfriend\\'s ratty sweatshirt and beanie.) We had the 35th St. Collins and 35th St. Martini specials for $5, a definite steal despite the cheap well liquor (it is happy hour, after all). The seasonal fruit was blood orange, and the cinnamon simple syrup added the perfect depth to my generously poured martini. This was way better than the well drink options you\\'d get for the same price at most cheaper restaurants! The frites and mussels were good. I rarely get mussels and can\\'t say they\\'re my favorite, but the good price (non-happy hour) for the combination tempted me to expand my horizons. The portion seemed generous, and they were yummy, but I wasn\\'t blown away by the mussels themselves. Then again, I never have been that impressed by mussels anywhere else, so no stars docked for that. I\\'m just glad I had the option to try them without breaking the bank. My boyfriend got a tummy ache later and blamed the mussels, but I have a sensitive stomach and was perfectly fine, so again - probably not the fault of the preparation. Now, the FRITES were to die for. Just the way I like them - not too thickly cut, seasoned with a bit of truffle oil and salt, and served with a superbly herbed house-made aioli. Mmmm...I\\'m not even a huge fry fan, but these were some of the best I\\'ve had. I like a waiter who can give guidance to try something out different, instead of responding blandly \\'well, it\\'s all good, just depends what you like.\" Joseph gave detailed answers to our questions and offered suggestions that we did not regret (e.g. a snifter of bourbon with amaretto - yum!) We also left feeling satisfied because the meal was rounded out by a nice bread basket (including shaved cinnamon raisin bread crisps...drool...). Being the waste-not foodie that I am, I asked for a box for the remainder of the bread and was asked - for the first time in my life - if we had butter at home. Yes, Joseph paid THAT much attention to detail that he thought about whether butter should be included in our to-go box. All in all, stellar and efficient service, great food and drinks, and a waiter who made us laugh and kept things interesting without being intrusive. If I\\'d been hungrier, I\\'d have purchased the fish of the day special without hesitation (some kind of white bean stew with halibut, scallops, pancetta, etc. - sounded like heaven!) I definitely plan on returning! PS - If I could add an extra star right now, I would. Just as I was about to post this review, I opened up my leftover bread box to find it filled to the brim with those awesome cinnamon raison crisps. &#160;I know I had almost cleaned them out of our basket before Joseph took it, and expected to find just the couple leftover plain bread pieces. &#160;Instead, he left us a little bonus present of the best of their breads. &#160;Tres bon!!!'},\n",

Even if we aren't discussing trade secrets or classified national security concern, I don't want strangers getting the low-down on my business. That kind of destroyed the otherwise-perfect-for-a-date, intimate type setting.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'I\\'ve heard that this place changed owners - and having gone back to try brunch again, I have to say I\\'m not lovin\\' it as much as I used to. 1. They changed coffee, switching to Lighthouse, which is usually good, however it appears they just brew it up and stick it in metal thermoses, and give it to you in coffee cups that are about half the size as they previously served. I swear they used to french press it, because you can definitely taste the difference between this coffee and their former. 2. Their Eggs Benedict used to be my favorite thing EVER. So I was disappointed when the one I ordered this time arrived looking different and tasting just so-so. The sauce was no longer heavenly, they changed the type of meat they stick in there, and the biscuits themselves tasted burnt on the bottom and strangely tough to chew. I know the food could just be \"eh\" depending on the chef that day, and the boyfriend said his stuffed french toast was just as good as before, but it bothers me that they\\'ve made changes that have affected my taste expectations but kept the prices are just as high as they\\'ve always been. 3. And (not that I\\'m necessarily complaining, because I love it), but they were blasting 80s music non-stop. Who does that in a fancypants french place?'},\n",

My husband and I celebrated our 3 year anniversary here tonight and I was so impressed with the food and service that I had to post a review right away. We arrived at 6:30, a half an hour early for our reservation and we were seated right away without a wait. After ogling the menu for a good 15 minutes we decided on a cheese plate with a few Charcuterie sides... specifically the prosciutto and salami picante. We chose a few cheeses and our waiter gave us a few suggestions. The Rouge Smokey Blue and Chabichou du Poitou were 2 of the best cheeses I have ever laid my taste buds on. If you go and order the blue cheese make sure to drizzle it with the honey... it is a flavor explosion!Half way through our cheese plate the waiter brought us a Salade Tiede de Courge Grilles. He explained that the kitchen had made an extra and that we were welcome to have it on the house. The combination of squash, bacon, peppery greens, and balsamic were absolutely perfect together. For the main course I had decided to order the fingerling tart and my husband opted for a delicious steak with matchstick pommes frites. The steak was cooked medium rare and the fries were perfectly salted. I didn't care for the tart so I didn't eat much of it. The waiter had asked how it tasted and I mentioned that I didn't personally care for it. &#160;The chef came to our table and offered me something different on the menu. When I declined (because I was way to full to try to substitute for anything) he told us that he was going to take the tart off of our check. All in all I have never received such great service from a restaurant. The staff was knowledgeable, friendly, and made our dining experience out of this world. The entire meal was worth every penny and I can not wait to recommend this cozy restaurant to all of my friends.\"},\n",

I like the decor with trees and sky windows in the restaurant . 7 of us were seated at a semi-private dining area which was really nice. I had squash pear soup, steak salad, and bread pudding with vanilla ice-cream. The soup was alright, it could be more flavorful. The steak was little overcooked; I requested medium but it came out medium well. I was happy with the bread pudding with vanilla ice-cream. It was delicious and made my entire meal worth it.Service was excellent. I would recommend this restaurant for a nice work lunch.'},\n",

Incredibly attentive service, but this may have something to do with the fact that, on a Sunday night, we were two of a total of 10 people in the restaurant from 7-9pm. This is a travesty! Such a lovely neighbourhood gem, particularly under the new ownership, should be nothing but bustling. The prices are very reasonable, considering the ambiance and fine french fare. This is a great place for special occaisions. But I must say, it was awkward to be in such an empty restaurant, as I do love the social, bustling atmosphere of dining in Seattle.

We started with a French onion soup, I ordered a coffee and she had a pomegranate and fresh squeezed orange martini (35th street martini). The French onion soup was good, not too salty with a thick layer of cheese. However it wasn\\'t hot enough, really only luke warm. For the entree, we had Croque Madame and the BLTEA sandwich. The \"Madame\" was amazing, brioche slightly crunchy with beschamel sauce, combined with salted ham. On the side, a large serving of spring greens with a light vinegrette. The BLTEA, not as great. The bread was overly toasted, which kinda ruined the greatness of the egg, bacon and avocado. &#160;The coffee was good but the martini was $10. Pretty steep for a drink at lunch.

       "  'text': 'After finishing a show in Belltown, my friends and I decided to find a bar closer to home to end our evening. We headed to 65th with the intention of hitting up The Tin Hat, but a large crowd and lack of seats inspired us to go a little further to 418 Public House. I am Irish, so when I see \"public house\", I have a very specific idea about what will be inside - Mexican fare is not that idea...Ok, so after the confusing introduction to the menu, we settled into a rather large table that easily accommodated our group of 7-8 people. We were disappointed to realize that there was no late night happy hour, but we didn\\'t want to attempt to all drive somewhere else. The cocktail menu was relatively interesting, though some combinations just seemed silly (i.e. anytype of liquor in a \"pino grigio float\"). The beer menu was better, and we ultimately decided on a pitcher of Manny\\'s and a pitcher of Bosun Black Porter. We ordered some pricey, but tasty, chips and salsa and settled into our night. It is worth mentioning that the bar was quite busy, and the bartender seemed to be very thinly spread, but it took almost 10 minutes to grab her attention, and when we did, the pitchers were sloppily filled leaving a solid 5\"-6\" of head floating on top. It took another 20 minutes or so to get our chips and salsa, the only food ordered due to the high prices. Once we settled in, we were grateful to all be seated together comfortably, and we were all able to enjoy our time. Because of the length of time our first drink orders took, only one person opted for a second drink, and most of us left sooner than we had intended.Ultimately, I would come back here for the regular happy hour for solid atmosphere, a good beer menu and cheaper food; however, the next our group of actors decides to head out for a post-show drink, we will opt for another location.'},\n",

I still love their Peking duck. I thought the skin was crispy. However, the crepe came with the Peking duck felt like Tortilla. I was a little disappointed.

       "   'text': 'I have now been to Yu Shan on three occasions, and have never been less than very satisfied and happy. My initial tip-off on this restaurant was from a guy from Beijing who drove all the way over from Lake Sammamish area for authentic food from Beijing and recommended it to us. My husband and I had a dish described to us by the waitress which is actually on the Mandarin-only menu, which is where some of the best, most interesting food at Yu Shan appears. The dish consisted of fried black mushrooms in strips, with onion strips, lots of garlic, and lots of cilantro!!! For us, the dish was so good I\\'d make a trip for it alone. I can\\'t remember the other dishes we ordered on that occasion, but they were very tasty.On the second occasion, I was with a large group of Chinese friends of mine, and we had so many different dishes, all had been ordered in advance, and they were all simply wonderful. Recently, I had lunch with a friend of mine, herself from a northern province of China. We had excellent food, including about 2 or 3 items from the Chinese-only menu. I loved everything, including those \"breakfast strips\", or whatever they are called: fried strips rolled up in a pancake/omelet, or something like that. We also had a sizzling rice dish, because I miss the days when most Chinese restaurants had nice large rice crusts to sop up soup or sauce. I was very happy to know there was still a place that makes them.The main thing about this restaurant is that it is NORTHERN Chinese food. So, all you Americans who think Chinese food is Kung Bao Chicken, Fried Rice, and Cantonese style dumplings, you need to learn that China is one very huge country. There are different food traditions in each area of China. Don\\'t have a Beijing dumpling and criticize it because it isn\\'t like a Cantonese dumpling. There\\'s nothing inauthentic about Yu Shan. And it\\'s always full of Chinese customers, so I hope no one else who reads Yelp first will come back and claim that this is Americanized Chinese food. Of course, if you don\\'t like it, you don\\'t like it, but that\\'s a personal taste issueIf the restaurant would attempt to translate the Chinese menu into English, I\\'d give them 5 stars!!'},\n",

We didn\\'t even check out the yelp score here which you definitely do it right. Always check out yelp review first.We went in and sat down and a nice girl welcomed us. Everything seemed fine until we ordered. The lady taking order was rude and didn\\'t explain anything. One strike.We ordered three entrees and one noodle because our kitchen is remodeling. And then came the 45 minutes wait. No one took care of us. No hot tea refill. No chatting. Nothing. And what\\'s even worse is that another big table, 8~10 guys there, who were later than us, had more than 6 entrees served. What? Is it us two starving people with nothing and 10 guys with full covered table? Unfair. Second strike.Than we asked the manager about our order and she came and left. It seems she did asked the kitchen something through that little window. But then she left! No, not coming back and telling us what\\'s going on. She disappeared. And we\\'re like confusing and starving and wondering at the same time. Everyone were so busy walking back and forth but no one even take a look at us. Third strike.Since the manager disappeared, we complained to the waitress and left. We went there expecting happiness and left even more starvingly. The manager eventually captured us at the parking lot and asked us why. And even at that time, she didn\\'t know what happened and asked us not to be mad because her crews are newly hired. What?

       "   'text': 'It never ceases to amaze (annoy) me when people eat at Chinese places then deem them \"americanized\" on Yelp when they order sweet &amp; sour pork and mushu beef. Economically speaking, these business must serve this blasphemous dishes to keep in business. Why? Because the greater American population can\\'t tell good Chinese cuisine from the mutant chicken entrails they\\'re cooking up at McD\\'s. Just like how \"pad thai\" is not actually a thai dish, neither is sweet &amp; sour pork. You know that sauce is made from ketchup right? No authentic place in China is gonna have some Heinz chilling in the back kitchen to cook you up some sweet and sour (read: fatass) sauce. Anyway, I came here today with a big group of my family\\'s friends. Some were from Beijing, which is the cuisine served here. They ordered Beijing specialties like the meat pancake and the duck. I ordered my usual Shanghai fare. Fantastic. Let\\'s break it down:House pork buns: The best I\\'ve had in the greater Seattle area. No lie. While these are not the regular \"xiao long bao\" you expect (they have a fluffier bun), they are juicy and have great meat. Man I devoured 2 within seconds. I\\'m definitely coming back just for these.Garlic eggplant: I like to think I\\'m an eggplant specialist. I order this dish everywhere. The flavor was great, but the skin of the eggplant was a bit chewy. Must\\'ve been a deep-fry error.Fried buns: I\\'m not sure how to describe this properly. They are \"bun strips\" that are fried with pork. It looks like noodles. It was fantastic--much better than the \"nian gao\" we usually fry with the same ingredients.Pea sprouts: Good, but needed more oil. The sprouts were not as young as I would\\'ve liked.Duck: Average. Make sure to ask for the special authentic wrapper (looks like a tortilla). It\\'s much better than the steamed bun things.Meat pancake: Good, but the crust was too thick. Good meat inside though! But the same meat as the pork buns.Flower fish: Amazing fish. This fish is specially cut and then deep fried in sauce so when served, the meat flakes beautifully so the fish looks like a flower. It was deelish. Fried \"breakfast sticks\": If you\\'re from China, you know what I\\'m talking about. These breakfast sticks are wrapped in egg/flour combo and served together. Quite tasty, even though it looks weird. Cold sliced beef: Always a Chinese favorite, this was made wonderfully well and topped with fresh parsley. Little sauce, very fresh.Red bean bars: As dessert, we got this. It was a bit too sweet and a tad oily but still pretty good.The hostess and the waitress were super nice to us. Granted, so spoke Chinese so they liked us a lot more. Ambiance: Well, it\\'s across the street from Deja Vu showgirls. C\\'mon -- Lake City Way is not exactly Bellevue. But who cares? The food is fantastic.Price: So worth it. How do I emphasize that without stretching the ooo\\'s on my \"SO\"?I recommend Yu Shan for a real, solid Chinese meal. New China Express is always open if you want to join the obese movement via Chinese food :)'},\n",

       "   'text': \"A lot of the reviews I've read for Yu Shan denigrate the restaurant. A common theme I see among the reviews is that people order dishes like fried rice and orange chicken. I'm not saying they shouldn't order these things or that they aren't crappy as people say but I really believe the strength of Yu Shan lies in the Northern Chinese dian xing (dim sum) items they offer.If you've only ever had Cantonese style dim sum, which is probably true for 99% of Americans, this might be pretty different. The Northern Chinese dim sum fare they offer here are excellent and made fresh. Me and my parents ordered the niu rou xian bing (beef pancakes), jiu cai he zi (chives pancakes), cha shao bao (pork buns), jiao zi (hand-made dumplings), Beijing-style xiao long bao (little dragon buns), dou jiang (fresh soy milk), and dou sha bing (red bean cake). Everything was fresh and extremely delicious although I prefer Shanghai-style xiao long bao over Beijing-style because the outer bun is a lot thinner. Next time we go we want to try the luo bo si bing (radish cakes) since you have to order them two days in advance for them to make it fresh.Yu Shan is near Bothell and pretty far away from where I live but I would definitely come here again. The outside of the restaurant is pretty run down and in a pretty shady neighborhood but the inside is adequately furnished and not so bad. The service was nothing special even though we were Chinese so I can imagine if you're not Chinese, service might be worse. If you come here, I can't vouch for the quality of their non dim sum items. Honestly, a lot of those menu items sounded like Americanized Chinese food (Kung Pao chicken aybody?). Try out their dim sum items and you might be pleasantly surprised.\"},\n",

       "   'text': 'This place kept coming up recently, and we decided to give it a try, since it\\'s less than 2 miles from home. They have free delivery in our area, but we figured it was worthwhile to get the vibe of it in person.I\\'m a bit surprised at the mediocre reviews calling Yu Shan \"Americanized.\" For us, this was the most authentic place we\\'ve eaten some of our favorite Chinese dishes outside China. Yes, I mean it. It could have been what we ordered, because I assume that Chicken Chow Mein would come out pretty standard here, but then again...The server that helped us was awesome, and very friendly. He was young, and easy to chat with. We ordered the fish in hot and spicy soup, garlic eggplant, and black pepper beef. He asked about spice level, and we told him go nuts, extra spicy, ma la, the works. We also asked a bit about other favorite Chinese dishes (my pronunciation isn\\'t great, so the iphone came out). He offered that if we called ahead with our requests, the kitchen would be able to make these dishes for us, despite them not being on the menu!! REALLY? Even a rather obscure and time-consuming sweet soup could be done. Impressive. I\\'ll be calling ahead for a special occasion, to be sure. When our meal came, we were both surprised to find the soup featured liberal use of szechuan peppercorns, which we love &amp; use at home, but are quite difficult to get in the States. It was mouth-tinglingly delicious, the peppercorns give it an interesting tingle that seems spicy, but isn\\'t painful to taste. The black pepper beef was a treat, chock full of little dried peppers and flavor. Again, a very masterful creation which was undoubtedly spicy, but never burning or overwhelming, or too lingering. Even the garlic eggplant had nice heat, perhaps a little richly sauced, but very good.I noticed that they had \"sliced pork with taro\" on the menu, a dish I\\'ve enjoyed greatly in China. I\\'ll be certain to try it here. I also believe that with the right conversation, more typical dishes like Mu Shu could come out quite well here. My only minor gripe, and this has been the case for Chinese food in Seattle in general, is that the issue of MSG is not addressed. I therefore assume that Yu Shan uses MSG. I don\\'t have an allergy, but I do like to limit consumption. Since they have been so pleasant with special requests, next time I\\'ll make a point of bringing this up with my order. I will absolutely be back. Yummy!'},\n",

They're pleasant, it's lovely inside (it used to be Fushen, before they bogged off to Aurora Avenue) and the portions are appropriate to the price point, i.e. generous enough.The fried rice is eh. I love me some fried rice so this annoys me. Their egg drop soup is great, the hot and sour...less so. Their selection of dim sum is good, with stellar congee available on Sundays.

Now... I don\\'t know what\\'s going on in Yu Shan, but the place is BEAUTIFUL inside... I took photo after photo, but it seems others may have, too (it looks better than the ones shown actually...)OK, all that aside, let\\'s cut to the chase. I actually just needed to use a phone. Everest was closed already. McD\\'s pay phone couldn\\'t get the call to go through. My cell couldn\\'t either. I\\'d been out there at this kind of tragic location waiting (after apartment browsing--big fat NO btw, especially since--2.5 hours later than I was already supposed to be picked up, wellll... yeah, um, I heard a nightmare of stories from the people who lived over there, which makes me REALLY wary of going there at \"real\" night).I want to love them, but they were kind of bitchy... ok really bitchy. I complimented the beautiful place... \"ok and do you want something else?\" with NO ONE THERE--cmon, 4:30 on a Saturday isn\\'t your peak, ladies, and I\\'m sorry I intruded, but I got effin\\' kerosene and antifreeze and even a smudge of black oily something hydroplaned onto me and smelled pretty rotten. At least it was cold so it wasn\\'t ME that got the oil change, OR ID I?I asked what I could eat with my hands--going home, snacking on appetizers was more prudent than um yeah digging in with a fork? pork buns and scallion cake were recommended. MSG was guaranteed not there two times. Let me tell ya something...They don\\'t know what MSG is or are big fat (well actually short stocky) liars. Only one thing (technically 2, but #2 ain\\'t in pork buns or rubber flava\\'void quesadilla ripoff, either!) can, just hours after consuming it, make me need a LOT... LOT of medicine... and make me SOOOO miserable. I mean ridiculously SO miserable. Beyond the lies, beyond a \"crab claw\" that is diced up shrimp breaded and fried (and $3 for EACH little tiny one--they were REALLY pushy about how many I was going to buy (0, at that price) when all I asked is \"what is it?\" as it\\'s not real natural to stuff the end of a claw with frozen shrimp and call it crab. Just sayin.The Scallion cake got tossed in a hurry--i barely chewed one undercooked rubbery piece (did search for non-rubber, none to be found)--and hey, I WAS the only one there. I even TIPPED THEM FOUR DOLLARS FOR A COUPLE UNCOOKED APPETIZERS...Oh, hmm... pork... undercooked....Are pork buns supposed to be... raw-ish? I seem to recall seeing someone else order them elsewhere, and they were cooked, go figure!The inside is best desscribed as \"bundle of entrails mashed together with starches and m s fucking g and coated in jock itch gravy. I\\'m STILL (at 3:31am) trying to get that HORRID jock itch gravy taste out of my mouth. I had to get a drink at McD\\'s just to not totally puke, but I even kept eating, thinking the first was just bad, then just trying to figure out what jock itch gravy is. It\\'s MSG, for one, but wow, RANK!!!Did I get a bad night? The place was immaculate. Not a stir in the house--and no one was there at lunch, either, when I picked the neighboring buffet (that I felt great after... until I spent another couple hours in the 41 degree windy rain with car crap (for the record, clothes were tossed and I was bathed, so that\\'s not it, pretty sure--my eyes burning don\\'t make a systemic reaction including a new one: I got a nice rash pattern that almost looked like a red BDSM butterfly smacked onto my body. Let me tell you to ... just say no. Unless you love MSG and jock itch aroma and want to taste and smell it for another 24 hours. If those were what they recommend, how sucky are the \"average\" dishes???If you\\'re over there, just... go to Everest. Really. Don\\'t even bother with this place. I look forward to seeing it get bought out by a Wendy\\'s or something equally offensive, just BECAUSE. (Besides, it\\'s a fast food strip, one I\\'m NOT going to be living near, for the record!)'},\n",

The three cup chicken was really good but it\\'s sweet just a heads up. The pepper beef was delish too but needed a bit more veggies. I loved how it came out still popping and hot. The seafood maw soup was average. The squirrel fish was really good but a tad expensive for the amount of fish you get. The steamed buns were okay and the 8 treasure rice/steamed sticky rice is a really good dessert. Overall, good food but even though it was slightly our fault, the fact they didn\\'t want to accept their own coupon upsets me slightly but otherwise great service and you feel really welcome!

Hubby at the House fried rice and said it was pretty good, this is his favorite thing to order from a Chinese place so he has pretty high standards. The kids shared the other fried rice and the chow mien and loved it all, they kept going back for seconds! I had the Beef and Broccoli, one of my favorite things to order when having Chinese and I really liked it!

The pancake tasted fishy not chive-ey, so they must be re-using their oil. The noodle stir-fry thing was quite ok after pouring the salt shaker onto it.
